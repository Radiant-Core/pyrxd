"""Persistent BIP44 HD wallet with gap-limit scanning for Radiant (coin type 512, per SLIP-0044).

Usage
-----
    async with ElectrumXClient(urls) as client:
        wallet = HdWallet.from_mnemonic("word1 ... word12")
        await wallet.refresh(client)
        addr = wallet.next_receive_address()
        balance = await wallet.get_balance(client)
        wallet.save(Path("wallet.dat"))

    # Later:
    wallet = HdWallet.load(Path("wallet.dat"), mnemonic="word1 ... word12")
    # or, if the file may not yet exist:
    wallet = HdWallet.load_or_create(Path("wallet.dat"), mnemonic="...")

File format (v2)
----------------
``[version(1B)][scrypt_salt(16B)][gcm_nonce(12B)][gcm_tag(16B)][ciphertext]``

Stream C/HD-hardening rationale (closes ultrareview re-review N1-N6):
- N1: ``_seed`` lives in :class:`SecretBytes` so repr/copy/pickle cannot
  exfiltrate it and ``zeroize()`` is available.
- N2: ``save()`` is atomic — mkstemp + fchmod 0o600 + fsync + os.replace.
  Mode 0o600 is set BEFORE any bytes are written so the file is never
  visible at a wider mode.
- N3: encryption key is derived via scrypt (per-file random salt) instead
  of static ``hash256(seed)[:32]``. Slow per-attempt cost limits offline
  brute force when the seed leaks but the file is recoverable.
- N4: AES-256-GCM (AEAD) replaces AES-256-CBC. A tampered ciphertext now
  fails ``decrypt_and_verify`` with ``ValueError`` instead of returning
  attacker-controlled JSON that would silently corrupt wallet state.
- N5: gap-scan re-raises network errors instead of silently treating
  failed lookups as "address unused" — a flaky network used to make a
  funded wallet look empty.
- N6: ``load()`` raises :class:`FileNotFoundError` when the file is
  missing. The previous silent-fresh-wallet behavior is preserved
  behind ``load_or_create()`` so callers opt in explicitly. A typo'd
  path no longer overwrites a real wallet on the next save.

        Why a property and not a stored field: the BIP39 seed lives in a scrubbable
        :class:`SecretBytes` (``zeroize`` memsets it), but an ``Xprv``'s private bytes are
        immutable ``bytes`` plus copies inside libsecp256k1's C memory, which CPython
        cannot overwrite in place. Holding the account xprv for the whole unlock window

        (``master_xprv_from_seed`` → hardened ``m/44'/coin'/account'``) means the only
        resident long-lived secret is the scrubbable seed; each derived xprv is a local

        byte-for-byte identical to the previously-stored xprv (proved in
