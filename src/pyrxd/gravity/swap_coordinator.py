"""Live-participant coordinator for the Gravity Taproot-HTLC atomic swap.

Drives the pure FSM in :mod:`pyrxd.gravity.swap_state` for ONE participant. This
module owns the safety policy that the FSM deliberately leaves out:

* the hard role invariant ``MAKER_SECRET_TAKER_LOCKS_BTC_FIRST`` (named, not an
  opaque "Combination #1");
* the cross-chain timelock **margin** check (fail-closed; cross-unit normalised);
* the **two-phase gates** (pre-BTC-lock validation + post-asset-lock
  re-validation, plan deepen-review H4);
* the **MAKER_STALLS** proactive-refund trigger (plan deepen-review C1).

Chain access is injected as duck-typed *legs* (a BTC leg + a Radiant leg) plus an
*indexer* and a *seen-store*. Per the plan's simplicity review we do NOT define a
``Protocol`` for the legs — concrete classes (``BitcoinTaprootLeg`` for BTC; a thin
wrapper over ``build_htlc_claim``/``build_htlc_refund`` for Radiant) and duck-typed
test fakes cover every coordinator path; a ``CounterChainLeg`` Protocol is deferred
until a 2nd backend (ETH) gives a real shape to generalise against.

Nothing here touches a live chain directly — every chain effect goes through an
injected leg, so the whole coordinator is exercised with mocks.

Design rules (house style)
--------------------------
* Frozen config dataclasses; ``__post_init__`` raises ``ValidationError``.
* The preimage ``p`` is held ONLY as :class:`pyrxd.security.secrets.SecretBytes`,
  in memory, zeroized after the BTC claim. It is never persisted, never logged,
  never placed in :class:`NegotiatedTerms`/:class:`SwapRecord`.
* No ``assert`` in ``src/`` — all invariants raise.

#
# THE DEFAULT BELOW IS *ESTIMATED*, NOT MEASURED. It is a placeholder so tests can
# run; per the global honesty rules it is labelled ESTIMATED and "real-value" mode
# (require_measured=True) refuses to use it — a measured value MUST be supplied for
# any mainnet swap carrying real funds.

# ESTIMATED placeholder (test-only). 36 blocks ≈ several BTC blocks of tail plus a
# Radiant reorg buffer; the real number must come from measured block data on both
# chains plus a stated reorg depth. DO NOT treat this as a finding.
