# pyrxd threat model

**Version:** 1.0 (draft)
**Last updated:** 2026-05-01
**Applies to:** pyrxd v0.3+ (library + CLI)

This document is the working threat model for pyrxd. It exists to:

1. Make explicit what pyrxd protects, and from whom.
2. Map every claimed protection to a concrete control in the codebase.
3. Surface gaps honestly so users, contributors, and (eventually) auditors can see what is and isn't covered.
4. Provide a starting point that an external security review can build on rather than recreate.

This is the threat model for experimental open-source software, provided as-is under the [LICENSE](../LICENSE), that people can choose to use. It is not a substitute for an independent third-party audit. The README states cryptographic primitives have not been independently audited; that remains true.

## Purpose & non-goals

### What pyrxd is

A Python SDK + CLI for the Radiant blockchain. It performs:

- Key generation, derivation, and signing (secp256k1, BIP32/39/44)
- Transaction construction, serialization, and signing
- Glyph token protocol operations (NFT mint, FT deploy, transfers)
- Gravity cross-chain BTC↔RXD atomic swaps
- SPV verification of Bitcoin transactions
- ElectrumX networking and Bitcoin data-source queries

### What pyrxd is NOT

- Not a hardware wallet integration
- Not a multi-signature coordination tool (single-sig only in v0.3)
- Not a node implementation (does not validate the chain itself; relies on ElectrumX)
- Not a custodial service or a smart-contract platform beyond what Radiant's consensus rules support

### Non-goals (explicit)

These are not protected by pyrxd controls:

- **Coercion attacks** (rubber-hose, $5 wrench attacks)
- **Physical attackers** with hands on the user's machine
- **Side-channel attacks at the silicon level** (Spectre/Meltdown class)
- **Compromise of the user's terminal emulator, OS, or hardware**
- **Compromise of the BIP39 wordlist file or scrypt KDF** (we trust upstream implementations)
- **Long-term post-quantum security** (secp256k1 itself is not post-quantum safe)

## Assets

Ranked roughly by value to an attacker:

| # | Asset | Form | Where it lives |
|---|-------|------|----------------|
| A1 | BIP39 mnemonic | 12 or 24 words | User's memory, paper, optionally encrypted in `wallet.dat` |
| A2 | BIP39 seed (PBKDF2 of A1) | 64 bytes | In-memory `SecretBytes` only; never persisted directly |
| A3 | Account-level xprv | base58check string | Derived in-memory from A2; never persisted |
| A4 | Per-address private keys | 32-byte scalar | Derived in-memory from A3; never persisted |
| A5 | Encrypted wallet file (`wallet.dat`) | AES-GCM-encrypted JSON | Disk at `~/.pyrxd/wallet.dat`, mode 0600 |
| A6 | Account-level xpub | base58check string | Watch-only-safe; can be exported via `wallet export-xpub` |
| A7 | An unsigned transaction | bytes | Transient; held in-memory during tx building |
| A8 | A signed transaction in flight | bytes | Transient; sent over wss to ElectrumX |
| A9 | UTXO ownership info | tuples (txid, vout, value, owner) | In-memory after `collect_spendable()`; on disk in `addresses` dict of wallet.dat |
| A10 | Network metadata (which addresses, balances, history) | observable on-chain | Public, but linkability matters for privacy |
| A11 | Unlocked wallet held by the signing agent | in-memory `HdWallet` (seed in `SecretBytes`) | The `pyrxd agent` daemon process, for the unlock window only; reachable via a `0600` Unix socket |

Control surfaces target the upper rows; A6 is intentionally exportable; A10 is unavoidable on a public chain.

## Threat actors

### TA1: Local post-compromise malware

**Capabilities:** read process memory, read files in `$HOME` with user permissions, tamper with stdin/stdout, modify dependencies on next install, exfiltrate over network.

**Goals:** A1, A2, A4, A5.

**Reach:** Once present, can do almost anything. pyrxd's controls provide **defense in depth at best**, not prevention. Encrypted wallet file slows exfiltration; `SecretBytes.zeroize()` slightly reduces window; nothing makes a compromised host safe.

### TA2: Local non-malicious user (footgun)

**Capabilities:** the user themselves making mistakes — pasting mnemonics into chat, running `wallet new` while screen-sharing, copying to clipboard, leaving terminal scrollback.

**Goals:** Not adversarial; a victim of accident.

**Reach:** Heavy. Most reported real-world key losses come from this category. pyrxd's job is to make accidents harder.

### TA3: Network passive observer

**Capabilities:** sniff packets between user and ElectrumX/BTC data sources.

**Goals:** A10 (link addresses to user's IP), inputs/outputs for chain analytics.

**Reach:** Limited if `wss://` is enforced (TLS). pyrxd defaults to `wss` and rejects `ws://` without `allow_insecure=True`.

### TA4: Network active MITM

**Capabilities:** intercept and modify traffic. Possible against `ws://` (rejected by default) or against TLS with a CA compromise.

**Goals:** Substitute attacker addresses into broadcast txs, suppress balance/history results to confuse the wallet, force fee bumps.

**Reach:** Mostly mitigated by TLS but degrades to TA5 if the user is using a hostile ElectrumX.

### TA5: Hostile ElectrumX operator

**Capabilities:** The remote endpoint pyrxd connects to. Can lie about anything it returns: balances, UTXO sets, transaction confirmations, headers. Cannot forge signatures or steal private keys.

**Goals:** Selective service denial (refuse to broadcast a tx, drop history queries), inducing wallet to derive new addresses (privacy attack), trickery to lure UTXOs into a malformed tx (limited by client-side validation).

**Reach:** Significant for privacy, limited for theft. The default config uses one public ElectrumX server (`electrumx.radiant4people.com`) which is a single point of trust.

### TA6: Hostile Bitcoin data source

**Capabilities:** A `BtcDataSource` (mempool.space, blockstream.info, Bitcoin Core RPC) used by Gravity for SPV proofs. Can lie about BTC-side data.

**Goals:** Forge a "BTC was sent" proof that fools the RXD-side covenant into releasing funds.

**Reach:** A self-consistent forged chain is byte-identical from every source, so `MultiSourceBtcDataSource` quorum — which only detects *disagreement* between sources — does **not** catch it. The actual forgery defense is the on-chain covenant's `expectedNBits` pin, now mirrored in the Python verifier (`verify_chain` enforces the nBits pin *before* PoW, audit F-01/F-03), with the Merkle-proof↔header binding (`build(tx_block_height=…)`, F-18) and an offer-time difficulty floor (`reject_low_difficulty`/`min_difficulty_nbits`, F-02). For confirmation depth, a single source under-reporting `block_height` inflates burial; the `[1,tip]` floor on `get_raw_tx` plus the above-dust `MultiSourceBtcFundingReader` quorum (F-17) mitigate it. The primitive must **not** be the sole release authority on a value-bearing chain without a covenant pinning nBits — enforced by `require_spv_sole_authority_cleared`. Full pitfall catalogue: [`docs/how-to/spv-verification-pitfalls.md`](how-to/spv-verification-pitfalls.md).

### TA7: Hostile metadata file author

**Capabilities:** Crafts a `metadata.json` and convinces the user to mint/deploy from it.

**Goals:** Make the user broadcast a transaction that locks funds or tokens to an attacker key without the user noticing. Crash the CLI with malformed CBOR. Embed a malicious URL or script reference.

**Reach:** Real and underappreciated. The user types `pyrxd glyph mint-nft alice-token.json` and trusts that the resulting token belongs to *them*. If the file's `owner_pkh` is the attacker's, the NFT is the attacker's.

### TA8: Hostile counterparty (Gravity)

**Capabilities:** The other party in an atomic swap. Wants to take both legs of the trade.

**Goals:** Exploit covenant bugs, race conditions, or incorrect SPV verification to claim BTC and RXD without delivering their side.

**Reach:** Direct financial impact if a bug exists. This is the single most adversarial setting in pyrxd. Mitigated by the covenant tests in `tests/test_gravity_red_team.py` (1500+ lines), but the README flags Gravity as "still being hardened" and "covenant variants" as work in progress.

### TA9: Supply-chain attacker

**Capabilities:** Compromise a release of `coincurve`, `Cryptodome`, `click`, `cbor2`, `aiohttp`, `websockets`; typosquat `pyrxd` on PyPI; or compromise pyrxd's own release pipeline.

**Goals:** Inject signing-time backdoor, exfiltrate seeds via network, replace key derivation with attacker-controlled values.

**Reach:** Catastrophic if successful. pyrxd's defenses are limited to: small dep tree, `pip-audit` for known CVEs, signed PyPI uploads, and trust in upstream maintainers. We do not pin transitive deps.

## Trust boundaries

Listed roughly inside-out; each is a place where data changes from "untrusted" to "validated and used":

1. **CLI argv** → parsed by click, validated by command handlers. Click handles type coercion for `int`, `float`, `Path`, `Choice`. Custom validation (address shape, ref shape) is in command bodies.
2. **Stdin** → mnemonic and passphrase input via `click.prompt(hide_input=True)`. Normalized via `_normalize_mnemonic` (whitespace collapse). Validated by `bip39.validate_mnemonic`. Never logged.
3. **Configuration files** → `~/.pyrxd/config.toml` parsed by stdlib `tomllib`. Schema-checked by `Config` dataclass. Mode permissions on parent dir checked.
4. **Wallet file (`wallet.dat`)** → AES-GCM authenticated decryption; tag mismatch raises before any post-decrypt code runs. File mode checked (0o600 required) before read.
5. **Metadata files (`metadata.json`)** → JSON parsed with stdlib. Protocol names mapped to `GlyphProtocol` ints. Validated by `GlyphMetadata.__post_init__`. Cap on payload size enforced by `decode_payload`.
6. **Network: WebSocket frames from ElectrumX** → JSON-RPC framed, size-capped at 10 MB. Response correlation is per-id (concurrent calls don't swap responses). Hex/bytes results validated as typed values (`Txid`, `RawTx`, `Hex32`).
7. **Network: HTTP responses from Bitcoin data sources** → Content-type checked, size-capped, hex-decoded with explicit length. URL construction uses `urllib.parse.quote`.
8. **Library API surface (caller → pyrxd)** → typed validation at constructors: `Hex32`, `Hex20`, `Txid`, `Satoshis`, `Photons`, `BlockHeight`, `Nbits`, `SighashFlag` all reject malformed inputs at construction. `PrivateKey`, `PublicKey` validate input bytes/strings.
9. **Internal: pyrxd → coincurve / Cryptodome** → these libraries are the trust root for crypto primitives. We do not re-implement.

## Threat scenarios

Each scenario lists actor → action → asset → control(s) → residual risk.

### S1: Mnemonic exfiltration via JSON-mode redirect (TA2)

- **Action:** User runs `pyrxd wallet new --json --yes | tee mnemonic.txt` to "save" the output, mnemonic ends up unencrypted on disk.
- **Asset:** A1.
- **Control:** README documents the pitfall explicitly. The default (interactive) flow shows the mnemonic with an Enter gate — no shell-redirect exposure.
- **Residual risk:** User error remains possible. Mitigation is documentation, not enforcement. Documented at `README.md#security-scripting-wallet-new-with---json---yes`.

### S2: Mnemonic exposure via terminal scrollback (TA2)

- **Action:** User runs interactive `pyrxd wallet new` in tmux/screen with scrollback enabled.
- **Asset:** A1.
- **Control:** README documents that interactive display still has terminal-history risks. Enter gate slows down accidental copy.
- **Residual risk:** High. We cannot clear scrollback portably.

### S3: Mnemonic exposure via clipboard manager (TA2)

- **Action:** User copy-pastes the mnemonic from terminal display; clipboard manager retains history.
- **Asset:** A1.
- **Control:** None in v0.3.
- **Residual risk:** Real. Tracked as [issue #11](https://github.com/Radiant-Core/pyrxd/issues/11) — add a clipboard-hygiene warning after the Enter gate.

### S4: Wallet decryption attempt with wrong mnemonic (TA1)

- **Action:** Attacker has wallet.dat (e.g., from backup leak). Tries to decrypt with random mnemonics.
- **Asset:** A5 → A1.
- **Controls:** scrypt KDF (n=2^14) imposes per-attempt CPU+memory cost; per-file salt prevents precomputed table reuse; AES-GCM tag detects all wrong guesses. Decrypt failure surfaces a single static message — never echoes attacker input.
- **Residual risk:** scrypt parameters are tuned for "BIP39 seed has 128+ bits of entropy" — they slow brute force but do not save a mnemonic that's been leaked elsewhere.

### S5: World-readable wallet file post-restore (TA1)

- **Action:** User restores wallet.dat via `cp` or `rsync`; file ends up at mode 0o644.
- **Asset:** A5.
- **Control:** Load-time mode check refuses to read a wallet file with group/other read bits and prints the chmod fix. Test: `tests/test_hd_wallet.py::test_load_rejects_world_readable_wallet_file`.
- **Residual risk:** macOS/Windows behavior may differ; check is gated to `os.name == "posix"`.

### S6: Stale signature attack via fee-pass interleave (architectural)

- **Action:** A bug in tx builder that signs trial outputs but builds final outputs differently. Attacker pays fee on user's trial-tx not their actual one.
- **Asset:** A4 + A8.
- **Control:** Two-pass fee algorithm explicitly resets `unlocking_script` between trial and final, then re-signs. Documented in `tests/test_preimage.py`. Tested in `RxdWallet` and `HdWallet` send/send_max paths.
- **Residual risk:** Any new tx-builder code path must follow the same pattern. Code review item.

### S7: Hostile metadata.json owner_pkh substitution (TA7)

- **Action:** User downloads `nft-metadata.json` from chat. The file contains the attacker's `owner_pkh` (or the metadata triggers a tx whose change goes to the attacker). User runs `pyrxd glyph mint-nft nft-metadata.json` and broadcasts.
- **Asset:** A8, indirectly the minted NFT.
- **Controls:**
  - Confirmation prompt before broadcast shows "funding utxo, funding value, commit value, network." This summary does NOT currently surface the embedded `owner_pkh` from the metadata.
  - `init-metadata` scaffolds a clean template that the user fills in themselves.
  - Out-of-band trust (user shouldn't run hostile files).
- **Residual risk:** Real. **Open finding:** the broadcast summary should display the resolved `owner_pkh` (and ASCII-render the address) before the user confirms. Tracked as a follow-up; will become an issue.

### S8: Hostile ElectrumX returns malformed UTXO record (TA5)

- **Action:** ElectrumX returns a UTXO with a value that doesn't match the on-chain truth. User signs a tx using that fake value.
- **Asset:** A4 (signs a misweighted tx).
- **Control:** None at the wallet layer; pyrxd does not independently re-fetch source-tx outputs to verify UTXO values for plain RXD sends. Gravity does this for BTC inputs via `MultiSourceBtcDataSource` quorum.
- **Residual risk:** Real but bounded. A lying ElectrumX can cause the user to overpay fees or build invalid txs (which the network rejects on broadcast — funds aren't lost, just confused). Cannot induce theft directly because the locking script is what controls the funds, and pyrxd builds locking scripts itself.

### S9: Hostile ElectrumX claims address is unused (TA5)

- **Action:** During gap-limit scan, ElectrumX returns empty `get_history` for an address that is actually funded. Wallet thinks address is unused; recommends it for next receive (or for change).
- **Asset:** A10 (privacy: linking sender to receiver).
- **Control:** Library N5 fix: `_scan_chain` re-raises `NetworkError` on lookup failure rather than silently treating as "unused." Re-using a known-funded address is impossible because the gap-limit logic stops at consecutive empty results, and each empty result is verified.
- **Residual risk:** A *consistently* lying ElectrumX could still hide history. Mitigation is network-layer source diversity (use multiple servers); not implemented for ElectrumX queries (only for BTC data sources). Tracked as a future enhancement — multi-source ElectrumX.

### S10: Hostile counterparty exploits a Gravity covenant bug (TA8)

- **Action:** Counterparty crafts a swap proposal that, if executed, leaves them with both legs.
- **Asset:** A8, real funds.
- **Controls:**
  - SPV verification of BTC proofs against header chain
  - Multi-source BtcDataSource quorum
  - Covenant code structurally derived from audited Photonic Wallet patterns
  - 1500+ lines of red-team tests in `test_gravity_red_team.py`
  - README explicit "experimental" flag on covenant variants
- **Residual risk:** Most concentrated risk in the codebase. Audit-recommended target.

### S11: Supply-chain compromise of `coincurve` (TA9)

- **Action:** Malicious `coincurve` release ships with backdoored signing.
- **Asset:** A4, every signature pyrxd produces.
- **Controls:** `pip-audit` in dev deps; `coincurve` is a high-attention package with multiple maintainers. We pin a major-version range, not a specific version.
- **Residual risk:** Catastrophic if exploited. Effective response would require upstream awareness or a security advisory, both of which we'd hear about via standard channels.

### S12: Typosquat of `pyrxd` itself (TA9)

- **Action:** Attacker publishes `py-rxd` or `pyrxd-tools` with malicious code; user installs the wrong package.
- **Asset:** Everything in the user's environment.
- **Control:** None (this is a PyPI registry concern). README links the canonical install path. `[project.urls]` in `pyproject.toml` points to the real repo.
- **Residual risk:** Outside pyrxd's control.

### S13: `--debug` traceback leaks frame locals (TA1, TA2)

- **Action:** User encounters a wallet decrypt failure with `--debug`; traceback is forwarded to a log aggregator that captures stderr; mnemonic local appears in the trace.
- **Asset:** A1.
- **Control:** `errors.CliError.show()` uses `traceback.format_exception(...)` only — never `capture_locals=True`. Source-line context contains variable names but never values. Tested in `test_debug_emits_traceback_on_decrypt_failure`: the user's exact input never appears in `result.output`.
- **Residual risk:** Source line text mentions `mnemonic` and `passphrase` as parameter names; an attacker reading the logs sees the *names* but not values. Acceptable.

### S14: Fee-rate flag set to 0 builds an unmineable tx (TA2)

- **Action:** User passes `--fee-rate 0` (currently rejected by validation) or somehow ends up with effectively-zero fee. Tx is built and broadcast; never confirms; funds appear stuck.
- **Asset:** A4 + A8 (operational, not theft).
- **Control:** `build_send_tx` and `build_send_max_tx` validate `fee_rate > 0`. Default fee rate of 10,000 photons/byte is the documented mainnet relay minimum.
- **Residual risk:** Low — if fee is below relay minimum, the network rejects on broadcast. Funds are not lost; user can rebuild with a higher fee.

### S15: Replay of a signed transaction (general)

- **Action:** Attacker re-broadcasts a signed tx the user already broadcast.
- **Asset:** A8 (already public, same tx confirms once).
- **Control:** Bitcoin/Radiant transactions are inherently non-replayable: they spend specific UTXOs, and once spent those UTXOs are gone. A re-broadcast either confirms the same tx (no-op) or is rejected as conflicting.
- **Residual risk:** None at this layer. Cross-chain Gravity introduces its own replay considerations, addressed by SPV-binding and counterparty-specific covenant params.

### S16: Race condition mid-`save()` corrupts wallet file (TA2 timing)

- **Action:** `wallet new` is interrupted (Ctrl-C, power loss) mid-write.
- **Asset:** A5.
- **Control:** Atomic write pattern: `mkstemp` → `fchmod 0o600` → write → `fsync` → `os.replace`. Either the old file remains intact, or the new fully-fsynced file does. No half-encrypted state.
- **Residual risk:** OS-level filesystem guarantees vary; we trust ext4/xfs/HFS+/APFS to honor `os.replace` atomicity.

### S17: Mnemonic in pytest result.output captured by failing assertion (TA1, hypothetical)

- **Action:** A test asserts on `result.output`, fails for an unrelated reason, pytest's traceback embeds the full output (including the mnemonic) in CI logs.
- **Asset:** A1 (synthetic — test mnemonics are random per run).
- **Control:** Tests use disposable mnemonics. CI logs are private.
- **Residual risk:** Low (synthetic mnemonics never hold real funds). Tracked as [issue #9](https://github.com/Radiant-Core/pyrxd/issues/9).

### S18: Same-uid process abuses the signing agent to spend (TA1) — issue #8

- **Action:** With the agent unlocked (A11), a malicious same-uid process connects to the socket and submits its own `SigningRequest` to drain the wallet. It passes `SO_PEERCRED` (same uid) and the `0600`/`0700` filesystem checks — those gate *other users*, not a co-resident attacker.
- **Asset:** A11 (the unlocked wallet) → A8 (a signed, fund-moving tx).
- **Control (THE control):** **per-spend confirmation.** The agent parses the tx, independently verifies each prevout (C1 — see S19), attributes every output (change re-derived and verified, the rest shown as external payees), and requires a human keypress **on the daemon's own controlling terminal** (`/dev/tty`) before signing — a channel the requesting process cannot drive. A detached daemon with no tty **fails closed** (declines). Small spends below an explicit, opt-in `--auto-confirm-under` threshold skip the prompt; that threshold is documented as outside the trust boundary. The agent **never returns key material** (conformance-tested), so reaching the socket lets an attacker *request* a signature, never *take* the key.
- **Residual risk:** A user who blind-confirms, or who sets a high `--auto-confirm-under`, is unprotected — by their own choice. The confirmation is the boundary; automation of it is out of scope. Idle auto-lock and `agent lock` bound the unlock window.

### S19: Agent tricked into a fee-theft / fund-redirect signature (TA1)

- **Action:** A request lies about an input's prevout value (to burn the surplus to fees) or asks for a non-`ALL|FORKID` sighash (to recombine the signature into a different, fund-redirecting tx), while showing the user a benign-looking spend.
- **Asset:** A4/A11 → A8.
- **Control:** **Prevout authenticity (C1)** — the agent requires the full source tx for each input, verifies it hashes to the input's outpoint, and reads value/script from the *real* prevout (never the request's claim); the displayed summary is derived from the verified tx (display == sign). The agent re-derives the signing key and refuses to sign an input it does not own. **Sighash policy** — v1 signs only `ALL|FORKID`; any other type is refused (it would commit to fewer outputs than the confirmation showed). Partially-owned txs are refused (every input must be attributable).
- **Residual risk:** v1 is P2PKH-only and fully-owned-only by design; multi-party / mixed-owner signing is out of scope.

### S20: Taker offline/censored during `[reveal, t_rxd]` — the R1 free-option residual (TA8)

- **Action:** Maker and taker reach `BOTH_LOCKED`. The maker claims the counter-leg (BTC/ETH), revealing `p` (`SECRET_REVEALED`). The honest taker is then offline, mempool-pinned, or censored across the window from that reveal to `t_rxd`. At `t_rxd` the maker CSV-refunds the Radiant covenant → `ASSET_VULNERABLE` → `ONE_SIDED_LOSS_TAKER` (`swap_state.py`): the taker has paid the counter-leg and the maker holds both legs. This is the inherent HTLC "free option" of the reveal-on-the-long-leg shape.
- **Asset:** the taker's funded counter-leg (A-cross) → maker.
- **Control(s) — what BOUNDS it (it is not eliminated):** the cross-clock timelock margin sizes `t_rxd` to open strictly before the counter-leg deadline minus the finality-stall-tolerant margin; the reorg-finality gate refuses an unsafe early claim (SAFE/WAIT/SQUEEZED, never a silent claim); the **value-scaled claim burial** (red-team 2026-06-12 HIGH, now enforced) requires the taker's claim to bury deep enough that reorging it costs ≥ the value at stake; and the proactive-refund window `N` is coupled to the finality+burial reserve so a reveal cannot be timed into a squeeze the taker could otherwise have acted in.
- **What is NOT a control (correct the record):** the watchtower does **not** autonomously claim the asset. On a `SAFE` gate it emits a `PAGE_CLAIM` **alert** (a display string + deadline) and **broadcasts nothing** — there is no `ClaimExecutor` in v1 (only `RefundExecutor`, which re-broadcasts an operator-pre-signed BTC refund and never touches `p`). So R1's closure rests on **operator/taker liveness within `t_rxd`** (respond to the page, claim before the deadline), not on automation. Any description of "watchtower auto-claim" as the R1 mitigation is wrong against the code.
- **Residual risk:** REAL and ACCEPTED (same as the BTC↔RXD direction) — this is the inherent HTLC free option, not a pyrxd bug. Surfaced loudly (never a silent `COMPLETED`). Closing it autonomously is a deferred reorg-gated claim executor (`watch/README.md` "Remaining"); until then, size `t_rxd` for the worst-case pin/eviction window the taker must survive online.

## Known gaps

Honest list. These are not vulnerabilities; they're places where pyrxd's defense ends.

### Crypto / library

1. **No third-party crypto audit** of pyrxd's integration of underlying primitives.
2. **No formal verification of BIP32/39/44 vectors** beyond unit tests. Test vectors come from the BIP specs themselves.
3. **No fuzz testing of the CLI surface.** [Issue #10.](https://github.com/Radiant-Core/pyrxd/issues/10)
4. **No timing-attack analysis** of pyrxd-internal comparisons beyond known-good `hmac.compare_digest` use.
5. **Memory zeroization is best-effort** — CPython does not guarantee secure memory. The signing agent's only resident **long-lived** secret is the seed (a `SecretBytes`), which IS `memset` on lock. The account xprv is **no longer stored long-lived** (hardening #8/H1): `HdWallet._xprv` is now a property that re-derives the account key from the seed per operation, so on lock the seed is scrubbed and the property fails closed — there is no persistent xprv copy to leak across the unlock window. The residual is now only the **transient** per-operation copy: while a signature is actively being produced, an account xprv / libsecp256k1 key necessarily exists in memory for that moment (you cannot sign without the key), and CPython cannot overwrite those immutable/C copies in place before GC. Their residency until the pages are reused is bounded by the agent's best-effort process hygiene (`mlock`/`PR_SET_DUMPABLE 0`/no core dumps), not a guaranteed erase — do not over-state it as "erased". This is the irreducible floor (the key must be usable to sign), not a design gap.

### Network

6. **Single-source RXD reads (accepted assumption, stated for the auditor).** Three RXD-side reads trust a single source by design: (a) the default single **ElectrumX** endpoint for plain-RXD wallet ops (TA5 has unmitigated reach here — multi-source ElectrumX is not implemented; only the Bitcoin data sources have quorum); (b) the single **RXinDexer** that resolves Glyph reads and backs the Gravity REF-authenticity gate (`verify_ref_authenticity`); (c) single-source RXD funding depth (a SPOF accepted only for dust). This is an **accepted assumption, not a missing control**: a *self-consistent* lie is byte-identical from every source, so adding a 2nd source — which only detects *disagreement* — has bounded value while the operating cost is real. The load-bearing defenses are the on-chain covenant pins (nBits / `expectedNBits`, the REF-uniqueness consensus rule), not read-side quorum. Standing up a 2nd independent RXD source is the right hardening **at first non-dust real value**; it is documented here so the audit reviews a stated single-source boundary up front rather than discovering it.
7. **No certificate pinning for ElectrumX TLS.** A CA compromise enables TA4. We rely on system trust store.
8. **The SPV primitive is not a self-sufficient sole authority.** It enforces the committed nBits pin and per-header PoW but does **not** do most-cumulative-work selection or independent network-difficulty oracling (audit F-01). It is safe only behind an on-chain covenant pinning nBits; any covenant-less use (bridge-in/oracle/gate) fails closed via `require_spv_sole_authority_cleared` pending external audit. See [`docs/how-to/spv-verification-pitfalls.md`](how-to/spv-verification-pitfalls.md).

### CLI

9. **Broadcast summary doesn't show resolved `owner_pkh` from metadata files.** S7 residual risk. **Should be addressed before v0.3.0 release.**
10. **No clipboard hygiene warning.** S3 residual risk. [Issue #11.](https://github.com/Radiant-Core/pyrxd/issues/11)
11. **Mnemonic re-entry per command** is mitigated by the optional `pyrxd agent` (issue #8, Path A′): a sign-on-behalf daemon holds the wallet for an unlock window so the mnemonic is typed once, and the key is removed from the short-lived CLI process entirely (the daemon signs). Residual: while unlocked, a same-uid process can *request* signatures — gated by per-spend confirmation (S18), never by taking the key. The agent is **opt-in**; with it off, the per-command prompt (and its S2/S3 residual risk) remains the default. The agent has not had a third-party audit (gap #1 applies).

### Protocol

12. **Gravity covenant variants flagged "still being hardened"** in README. TA8 is the highest-stakes attacker; this is the highest-priority audit target.
13. **dMint V1 deploy + PoW mint: now regtest-consensus-validated.** The earlier "documented but not implemented" wording was stale — the builders + reference miner shipped; the real gap was node validation. `tests/test_dmint_v1_regtest_e2e.py` proves on a real `radiant-core` node that a pyrxd-built V1 deploy (commit→reveal genesis) and a PoW-mined mint are accepted, a wrong nonce is rejected, and the contract recreates at height+1. Surfaced a consensus requirement the golden vectors missed: V1 contracts MUST be 1-photon singletons (covenant enforces `OP_OUTPUTVALUE==1`); `build_dmint_mint_tx` now rejects non-1 carriers early. **dMint V2 is now consensus-validated too (#219):** the canonical-Photonic redesign is byte-matched to upstream and accepted on `radiant-core` v3.1.1 regtest (FIXED + LWMA, with on-chain difficulty advancement) AND Radiant mainnet 3.1.2: the first V2 FIXED deploy + PoW mint confirmed on mainnet (deploy `95335028…bb16fb09`, mint `1239f64a…e0cd6c67`), plus an LWMA mint that lowered the recreated target on-chain (MAX → ~MAX/8) exactly matching the off-chain DAA (deploy `dea3beb9…`, mint `e7b52f16…`) — so adaptive difficulty is proven on mainnet, not just regtest. The per-call `V2UnvalidatedWarning` is no longer emitted; V2 deploys stay behind `allow_v2_deploy=True` as an explicit opt-in for the newer format. All five DAA modes are now ported and byte-matched to canonical Photonic, and the `glyph deploy-dmint --v2` / `claim-dmint` CLI verbs expose V2 deploy + PoW mint. **EPOCH int64-overflow: found, fixed upstream, re-enabled.** Differential testing of the ported modes surfaced an int64-overflow in the *canonical Photonic* EPOCH (and LWMA) bytecode — the on-chain retarget computed `target × clampedDelta` (multiply-first, output capped at `MAX_TARGET` not `2^48`), which exceeds int64 (`CScriptNum`) for ordinary parameters and aborts the mint with `INVALID_NUMBER_RANGE_64_BIT` (`OP_MUL → safeMul`), permanently bricking the contract (a liveness bug, not a theft vector — confirmed against `radiant-core` `interpreter.cpp`). EPOCH was temporarily refused at deploy while the canonical bytecode was broken; the fix is now **merged upstream** ([`Radiant-Core/Photonic-Wallet#2`](https://github.com/Radiant-Core/Photonic-Wallet/pull/2) — EPOCH clamps the target to `EPOCH_MAX_SAFE_TARGET` (2^48) on *both* sides of the multiply and divides first, so the intermediate stays ≤ 2^52 for any reachable state; LWMA floors `timeDelta` at 0 via `OP_0 OP_MAX`). pyrxd **byte-matches the merged canonical** (EPOCH+LWMA golden vectors regenerated; the off-chain miner replicas `compute_next_target_epoch`/`_linear` updated to match), and `DmintV2DeployParams` / the CLI now accept `DaaMode.EPOCH` again (difficulty ≥ 32768 for the 2^48 cap). The off-chain `current_time` validation (reject backwards/post-2038 locktimes before grinding) is retained as defence-in-depth. Residual: this newer surface is unaudited — verify it yourself before moving real value.
14. **No multi-signature support.** Single-sig only; users wanting m-of-n must build it themselves.

### Supply chain

15. **No pinned transitive dependency hashes.** A compromised release of `coincurve`, `Cryptodome`, etc. would propagate. `pip-audit` catches known CVEs but not zero-days. (Deliberate for a *library* — pinning transitive hashes over-constrains downstreams.)
16. **SBOM now generated.** Each GitHub Release attaches a CycloneDX SBOM (`pyrxd-<version>.cdx.json`) built from the resolved dependency tree by the publish workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`).
17. **Release artifacts now carry PEP 740 attestations.** PyPI 2FA + OIDC Trusted Publishing are on, and the publish action emits per-artifact Sigstore digital attestations (verifiable on the PyPI project page). A gpg-signed git tag / GitHub Release signature is still optional and not set up.

### Process

18. **Incident-response runbook now exists.** [`docs/runbooks/incident-response.md`](runbooks/incident-response.md) documents the triage → fix-branch → GitHub Security Advisory / CVE → release → notify flow for a report to `security@mudwoodlabs.com`.
19. ~~No coordinated-disclosure SLA.~~ **Resolved:** [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) states the SLA — acknowledge within 2 business days, initial assessment within 7, coordinated disclosure typically within 90 (Project Zero norms).
20. **No external eyes.** Solo developer; nothing has been reviewed by anyone else. An independent audit is the natural next step before relying on the swap stack for non-dust real value — verify it yourself until then.

## Out of scope (explicit non-coverage)

We do not protect against:

- Coercion / wrench attacks
- Physical access to an unlocked machine
- Compromised OS, firmware, BIOS, hypervisor
- Side channels at the silicon level
- Quantum computers (secp256k1 is not post-quantum safe; no chain currently is)
- User running the wrong binary (typosquats, malicious forks)
- User leaking the mnemonic via channels pyrxd doesn't see (photographing it, reading it aloud on a podcast, etc.)
- User running pyrxd in a hostile container that can read process memory
- Future Radiant consensus bugs that invalidate the protocol pyrxd implements

## For auditors and security researchers

> A consolidated [**security audit scoping brief**](security-audit-scope.md) pulls the in-scope
> module map, the load-bearing assumptions, the fail-closed opt-in gates, and the **complete
> stable-ID residual register** (this doc's scenarios *plus* the design-note and in-code residuals)
> into one place — start there for a commissioned audit.

If you have time and skill to look at pyrxd, here's where to start, ranked by expected return on investigation:

1. **Gravity covenant code** (`src/pyrxd/gravity/`) — highest stakes, most complex protocol code. Review focus: SPV proof construction, covenant param validation, sighash flag handling, edge cases in `tests/test_gravity_red_team.py` that document known concerns.

2. **Wallet file format and load path** (`src/pyrxd/hd/wallet.py:save/load`) — second-highest stakes (key material). Review focus: AEAD construction, mode-bit checks, malformed-JSON guards, the edge between "file decrypts" and "file is structurally valid wallet."

3. **Glyph script construction** (`src/pyrxd/glyph/`) — lower direct stakes (most attacks here are footguns, not theft) but the metadata-trust issue (S7) is real. Review focus: how `owner_pkh` propagates from CBOR to scriptPubKey to broadcast, and what the user actually sees before signing.

4. **CLI mnemonic handling** (`src/pyrxd/cli/wallet_cmds.py`, `src/pyrxd/cli/prompts.py`) — boring but easy to mess up. Review focus: every code path that touches the mnemonic string, and confirmation that none of them log, copy to dict-keyed structures, or serialize without `SecretBytes`.

5. **Network response parsing** (`src/pyrxd/network/electrumx.py`, `src/pyrxd/network/bitcoin.py`) — not where private keys live but where lying-server defenses live. Review focus: hex decoding, length checks, content-type validation, response-correlation race window.

If you find something, please report privately to `security@mudwoodlabs.com`. We don't pay bounties yet but credit researchers in `SECURITY.md` and in the changelog.

## Revision history

- **2026-06-15** — fixed the duplicate gap-`#8` numbering: the "Known gaps" list now runs `1–20` uniquely (the CLI `owner_pkh` gap moved `8→9` and the tail shifted `+1`). Added the consolidated [security audit scoping brief](security-audit-scope.md) (stable residual IDs across this doc, the design notes, and in-code residuals).
- **2026-05-01** v1.0 — initial threat model. Documents v0.3 surface (library + CLI + glyph commands).

Future revisions should bump the version, add an entry, and call out which sections changed.
