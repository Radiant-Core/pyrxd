# Mint a Glyph FT

**Goal:** issue your own fungible token on Radiant mainnet, from zero to a
broadcastable reveal transaction, using pyrxd 0.8.0.

This tutorial walks the canonical two-transaction flow:

1. **Commit tx** — places the metadata-hashlock script on chain.
2. **Reveal tx** — spends the commit and emits a single 75-byte FT output
   carrying your entire premine supply. The **commit outpoint**
   (`commit_txid:commit_vout`) — *not* the reveal txid — is the
   permanent token reference embedded in that output.

The runnable reference is
[`examples/ft_deploy_premine.py`](https://github.com/Radiant-Core/pyrxd/tree/main/examples/ft_deploy_premine.py).
This page walks the same flow step-by-step. By default everything is a
dry run — no transaction is broadcast unless you explicitly opt in.

## Before you start

You should already be comfortable with the
[first-transaction tutorial](your-first-radiant-transaction.md)
patterns: a funded WIF key, ElectrumX, fee math. If you've also minted
a Glyph NFT before, this is the same commit/reveal shape with two
differences:

- the protocol vector is `[FT]` (`[1]`), not `[NFT]` (`[2]`);
- the reveal output is the 75-byte FT lock instead of the 63-byte NFT
  singleton, and it carries a premine *amount* (photons) instead of a
  single 1-photon NFT token.

The 75-byte FT script shape and the consensus rules behind it are
explained in
[Radiant FTs are on-chain](../concepts/radiant-fts-are-on-chain.md) —
keep that page open in another tab. This tutorial does not re-derive the
script layout.

You will need:

- a WIF private key for a Radiant address holding enough RXD to cover
  the commit, the reveal, the premine, and fees;
- pyrxd 0.8.0 installed (`pip install "pyrxd>=0.8.0"`);
- an ElectrumX endpoint (the example defaults to a public
  radiant4people node).

## Step 1: design the token

Decide three things up front. None of them can be changed after the
deploy:

| Field           | Example          | Notes                                                                                                 |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`          | `"My Token"`     | Human-readable name, free-form string.                                                                |
| `ticker`        | `"MTK"`          | Ticker symbol; convention is uppercase, ≤16 chars.                                                    |
| `decimals`      | `0`              | **Display** precision only — consensus is always "1 photon = 1 FT unit." See note below.              |
| Premine amount  | `1_000_000`      | Integer FT units = photons in the reveal's FT output. Must be ≥ 546 (dust limit).                     |

```{note}
`decimals` is a display hint for wallets, not a consensus quantity.
Radiant's FT conservation rule operates on photons. A token with
`decimals=2` and a premine of `1_000_000` photons displays as
`10_000.00` units in supporting wallets but is still exactly
1,000,000 photons on chain.
```

## Step 2: build the metadata

`GlyphMetadata` is the payload that gets CBOR-encoded into the reveal
scriptSig. For a plain FT, the only required protocol marker is
`GlyphProtocol.FT`:

```python
import time
from pyrxd.glyph import GlyphMetadata, GlyphProtocol

metadata = GlyphMetadata(
    protocol=[GlyphProtocol.FT],   # [1] — plain fungible token
    name="My Token",
    ticker="MTK",
    description="My Token — issued via pyrxd",
    decimals=0,
    attrs={"issued_at": str(int(time.time()))},
)
```

```{important}
Set `protocol=[GlyphProtocol.FT]` for a plain FT. Use
`[GlyphProtocol.FT, GlyphProtocol.DMINT]` only if you want a dMint
distribution token (parallel mining contracts) — that flow is covered
in [V1 dMint deploys](../concepts/dmint-v1-deploy.md). Plain FTs and
dMint FTs share the 75-byte output shape but use different deploy
methods. This tutorial covers plain FT only.
```

## Step 3: derive the commit script

`GlyphBuilder.prepare_commit` takes the metadata plus the owner's PKH
(20-byte hash160 of the public key) and returns the commit locking
script, the CBOR bytes you'll need at reveal time, and the payload
hash committed into the script:

```python
from pyrxd.glyph import GlyphBuilder
from pyrxd.glyph.builder import CommitParams
from pyrxd.keys import PrivateKey
from pyrxd.security.types import Hex20

private_key = PrivateKey(GLYPH_WIF)            # your funded WIF
pub = private_key.public_key()
address = pub.address()
pkh = Hex20(pub.hash160())

builder = GlyphBuilder()
commit_result = builder.prepare_commit(
    CommitParams(
        metadata=metadata,
        owner_pkh=pkh,
        change_pkh=pkh,
        funding_satoshis=0,           # not load-bearing for plain FT
    )
)
# commit_result.commit_script — bytes; place at vout[0] of the commit tx
# commit_result.cbor_bytes    — bytes; save these for the reveal scriptSig
# commit_result.payload_hash  — bytes32; committed inside commit_script
```

`prepare_commit` reads `metadata.protocol`: because `NFT (2)` is **not**
in the list, the commit script is built as the FT-shaped commit
(`OP_1 / OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY` ref-count check) rather than the NFT
singleton shape.

```{warning}
Save `commit_result.cbor_bytes` somewhere durable before broadcasting
the commit. The reveal scriptSig has to push the *exact* same CBOR
bytes you committed to — regenerating from the metadata is fine for a
deterministic build, but the example script writes `cbor_hex` plus
`commit_txid` to `/tmp/ft_deploy_resume.json` so a crashed reveal can
be resumed without recomputing.
```

## Step 4: broadcast the commit tx

The commit tx is an ordinary spend of P2PKH UTXOs that produces two
outputs:

- `vout[0]` — `commit_result.commit_script` with a value large enough
  to cover the reveal's fee **and** the premine output. The reference
  example targets ≈ `(REVEAL_SIZE × MIN_FEE_RATE × 1.2) + PREMINE_AMOUNT
  + 200_000` photons for comfortable headroom.
- `vout[1]` — change back to your address as plain P2PKH.

Construction details (P2PKH unlock template, fee model,
`Transaction.sign()`) match the demo and are not specific to FT —
see `build_commit_tx` in
[`examples/ft_deploy_premine.py`](https://github.com/Radiant-Core/pyrxd/tree/main/examples/ft_deploy_premine.py).

```{note}
**DRY_RUN by default.** The reference example sets
`DRY_RUN = os.environ.get("DRY_RUN", "1") != "0"`. The commit tx is
*built and signed* but is only broadcast when you set `DRY_RUN=0`.
This is deliberate — running a script that prints transaction hex is
safe; broadcasting requires explicit opt-in.
```

After broadcasting, wait for the commit to confirm before building the
reveal. The reference example sleeps 90 seconds; production code
should poll the node or wait for a block.

## Step 5: build the reveal

This is the only FT-specific call in the deploy. Pass the confirmed
commit outpoint, the CBOR bytes saved at commit time, the recipient
PKH (you, for a self-premine), and the integer premine amount:

```python
reveal_scripts = builder.prepare_ft_deploy_reveal(
    commit_txid=commit_txid,
    commit_vout=commit_vout,           # 0 in the reference shape
    commit_value=commit_value,         # photons in the commit output
    cbor_bytes=commit_result.cbor_bytes,
    premine_pkh=pkh,
    premine_amount=1_000_000,          # your token supply, in photons
)
# reveal_scripts.locking_script   — 75 bytes, the FT lock; goes at vout[0]
# reveal_scripts.scriptsig_suffix — 'gly' + CBOR; goes after sig + pubkey
# reveal_scripts.premine_amount   — set vout[0].value to exactly this
```

The returned `locking_script` is the canonical 75-byte FT shape:
P2PKH (25 bytes) → `OP_STATESEPARATOR` → `OP_PUSHINPUTREF <ref>` (38 bytes)
→ the 12-byte FT-CSH conservation epilogue `dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d`.
See [Radiant FTs are on-chain](../concepts/radiant-fts-are-on-chain.md)
for the byte-by-byte breakdown — the bytes `prepare_ft_deploy_reveal`
emits match that layout exactly.

```{warning}
`premine_amount < 546` is rejected at build time as below the dust
limit (most mempool policies refuse the reveal otherwise). If you
want a smaller supply, pick a different token model (NFT, or scale up
with `decimals`).
```

The reveal tx spends `vout[0]` of the commit and produces *one*
output — `vout[0]` carries the entire premine to `premine_pkh`. The
**commit outpoint** `(commit_txid, commit_vout)` — *not* the reveal
txid — is the permanent token reference: it is the ref
`prepare_ft_deploy_reveal` embeds in the FT locking script, and every
future transfer of this FT will encode the same 36 bytes inside its
output script.

Two practical points the reference example handles for you:

- **scriptSig layout.** The reveal-input scriptSig is the normal
  P2PKH `<sig> <pubkey>` push pair followed by
  `scriptsig_suffix`. The example wraps this in
  `ft_reveal_unlock_template`.
- **Two-pass fee.** Because the FT output's value equals `premine_amount`
  exactly (1 photon = 1 FT unit), there is no change output to absorb
  fee imprecision. The example signs a trial tx, measures its byte
  length, computes the fee, and verifies
  `commit_value - premine_amount - fee >= 0` before signing the final
  tx.

## Step 6: broadcast and verify

With `DRY_RUN=0` and a confirmed commit, broadcast the reveal. On
acceptance you have:

- **Token ref:** the **commit outpoint** `{commit_txid}:{commit_vout}`
  — *not* the reveal txid — is the 36-byte ref encoded into every FT
  UTXO of this token. This is the ref you use to look up or transfer
  the token; getting it wrong means you can't find your own supply.
- **Supply:** exactly `premine_amount` photons, living at
  `reveal_scripts.locking_script` at the address derived from
  `premine_pkh`.

Sanity-check the result with the inspect tool:

```bash
$ pyrxd glyph inspect <reveal_txid> --fetch
Transaction: <reveal_txid>
  size:    268 bytes
  inputs:  1
  outputs: 1

Outputs:
  vout   0  type=ft          sats=1000000
            ref=<commit_txid>:<commit_vout>
            owner_pkh=<your_pkh>
```

The `ref` line is the **commit outpoint**, not the reveal txid — that
is the token's permanent identity. `type=ft` confirms the locking
script matches the 75-byte FT shape and
its embedded ref points at itself — i.e. this is a freshly deployed
FT. Any wallet implementing the standard FT classifier
(`is_ft_script` + `extract_ref_from_ft_script`) will recognise it
without an indexer.

## What's next

- **Send some tokens.** Once the reveal confirms, you can transfer
  units of the token using `GlyphBuilder.build_ft_transfer_tx`. The
  load-bearing prerequisite — filtering wallet UTXOs to the correct
  75-byte FT shape *and* the right token ref — is explained at length
  in [Radiant FTs are on-chain](../concepts/radiant-fts-are-on-chain.md)
  and demonstrated end-to-end in
  [`examples/ft_transfer_demo.py`](https://github.com/Radiant-Core/pyrxd/tree/main/examples/ft_transfer_demo.py).
- **Distribute by mining instead of premining.** If you want supply
  emitted by parallel proof-of-work contracts rather than handed to a
  single address up front, that's a *dMint* deploy
  (`protocol=[FT, DMINT]`) — see
  [V1 dMint deploys](../concepts/dmint-v1-deploy.md). It's a
  different builder method (`prepare_dmint_deploy`) and a three-tx
  flow, not the two-tx flow on this page.
- **Migrating from pyrxd 0.4.x?** Plain-FT deploy is unchanged in
  0.8.0; only the V1 dMint *mint* path has breaking signature
  changes. See [Migrate from 0.4 to 0.5](../how-to/migrate-0.4-to-0.5.md)
  if you have a custom miner.
