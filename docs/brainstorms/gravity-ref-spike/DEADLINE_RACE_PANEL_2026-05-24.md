# Deadline-race expert panel — findings (2026-05-24)

Four independent reviewers (cross-chain security architect, Bitcoin
consensus/timelock expert, protocol-simplicity reviewer, adversarial
game-theorist), writing blind. They converged.

## The vulnerability

Taker pays BTC (irreversible) to the maker's plain address, then must land an
on-chain SPV proof in Radiant `finalize` before a wall-clock `claimDeadline`;
else the maker's permissionless CLTV `forfeit` reclaims the asset. If BTC blocks
are slow / the payment is mined late / the maker set a tight deadline, the taker
loses the BTC AND gets no asset. `finalize`/`forfeit` spend the same UTXO
(mutually exclusive); the danger is purely *which clock fires first*.

## THE ROOT CAUSE (most important finding)

**The irreversibility is on the Bitcoin side.** The BTC payment goes to a plain
address with **no refund path** — once sent it is gone no matter what Radiant
does. Therefore **no Radiant-side deadline change can give the taker recourse.**
The current design is a *one-directional SPV oracle*, NOT an atomic swap. Every
deadline-tuning option leaves this hole; only binding the two legs closes it.

Also: `tx.time` is `>=`-only (OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY is a consensus "not-before"
lower bound; rxdc rejects `<`). An in-script upper-bound deadline is impossible.
So the "deadline" is really *the moment the maker's forfeit becomes spendable*,
not a cutoff on the taker.

## Option verdicts (unanimous)

| Option | Verdict | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Maker-signature-gated forfeit | **REJECT — strictly worse** | Doesn't stop a malicious maker (signs anyway); introduces PERMANENT asset stranding if maker vanishes + an extortion lever. Removes the permissionless liveness backstop. |
| Bond / forfeit-delay | Supplementary only | Maker prices a bond below a unique NFT's subjective value (eats it, keeps BTC); a fixed delay never creates an upper bound. Delay (= wide deadline) is a free margin knob, keep it; bonds are YAGNI/redundant (SPV already proves payment). |
| Timestamp-based deadline | Necessary-not-sufficient AND must be work-based | A single header timestamp is miner-skewable **±2h** (the 2-hour future-time rule); median-of-N is bounded but needs majority-miner cooperation + lags ~1h. Worse: it re-times `finalize` only — `forfeit`'s clock is untouched, so the race just relocates. If judged on timestamps (not work) it also invites taker header-grinding. |
| **Confirmation-depth / cumulative-PoW maturity** | **Correct primitive for the BTC side** | Self-stretches under slow blocks (the exact failure mode); ZERO timestamp-skew surface; only defeatable by a real K-deep BTC reorg = the SPV assumption you already accept. Bitcoin headers carry no height, but the proof already proves cumulative work. |
| **CSV (relative timelock, in blocks) on forfeit** | **Correct primitive for the Radiant side** | Anchors forfeit-eligibility to the covenant UTXO's own confirmation depth (Radiant blocks since funding), immune to any Bitcoin clock and to absolute-time skew. (NEEDS source check: confirm Radiant enables OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY + BIP68/112 flag semantics.) |
| Client-side "don't pay until safe" precondition | Necessary, NOT sufficient | The covenant is immutable + params visible pre-payment, so the taker CAN refuse a too-tight window (defeats accidental slow-block grief). But BTC confirmation time has no finite upper bound and the maker controls the deadline → a malicious "future-but-unsatisfiable" deadline still wins on the tail. Cheapest first move; ship it, but it doesn't close the malicious-maker hole. |
| **HTLC / adaptor signatures (true atomic swap)** | **The only fix that ELIMINATES one-sided loss** | Binds both legs with a shared secret so worst case = "both refund," never "taker loses BTC." Requires the BTC payment to go into an HTLC output (with a taker refund branch), not a plain address. |

## Two load-bearing technical findings

1. **A naive hashlock HTLC is likely BROKEN across these chains:** Radiant uses
   SHA512/256d, Bitcoin uses SHA256d — a shared `hash(secret)` lock won't match
   on both sides. **Adaptor signatures** (secret = a scalar revealed by a
   signature, not a hashlock) are the correct primitive and sidestep the hash
   mismatch. NEEDS source check: rxdc adaptor-sig / Schnorr support is unverified.
2. **HTLC timelock ordering is a hard safety constraint:** the chain where the
   secret is revealed SECOND must have the LONGER timelock. Here the secret is
   revealed on Radiant (taker claims), then the maker uses it on Bitcoin → the
   **Bitcoin refund timelock must exceed the Radiant claim timelock** by a margin
   covering reorg depth + relay + congestion. The taker's client MUST verify this
   ordering before paying, or a malicious maker mis-sets it.

## Recommended end-states (panel consensus)

**Combination A — atomic (the real fix, larger work):**
adaptor-signature swap (BTC HTLC output with taker-refund branch) + client-side
timelock-ordering check (`t_BTC − t_RXD ≥ margin`, Bitcoin holds the longer
lock). No adversary strategy survives; worst case is mutual refund. Engineering
risk: BTC-side HTLC output, getting the secret to Radiant, adaptor-sig support.

**Combination B — non-atomic hardening (defensible fallback, keeps current shape):**
(1) confirmation-depth / cumulative-PoW maturity on `finalize` (work, not
timestamps) + (2) CSV relative-block lock on `forfeit` + (3) client-side P99-tail
margin check at pay-time. Reduces the race to a *symmetric* slow-block tail
(non-adversarial), drivable toward zero by margin width — but does NOT provably
eliminate one-sided loss, because the BTC payment still has no refund path.
Explicitly NOT maker-sig forfeit (regression).

## Honesty / open verifications before building either
- Radiant CSV/BIP68/112 parity (read interpreter.cpp CheckSequence + flags).
- What `tx.time` binds to in the Radiant interpreter (nLockTime vs MTP).
- rxdc adaptor-sig / Schnorr support (gates Combination A).
- Whether a median-of-N-timestamps or work-threshold fits the covenant's
  script-size budget (compile-test; the covenant is already ~8-11KB).
- The P99 margin is an ESTIMATE — derive from observed BTC inter-block data.

## The blunt takeaway
The Gravity swap as built is not atomic, and for an irreversible NFT that is the
dominant risk — bigger than the parser bugs already fixed. The honest options are
(A) build the adaptor-sig atomic swap, or (B) ship the work-maturity + CSV +
client-margin hardening AND document plainly that one-sided BTC loss on a
pathological tail remains possible because the BTC leg has no refund. Maker-sig
forfeit and bonds are not real fixes.
