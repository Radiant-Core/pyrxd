# Ref-bearing Gravity covenant — Phase 2 design

**Purpose.** Concrete covenant design for FT-for-BTC swaps, written
*before* compiling any bytecode so it can take the adversarial-review
checkpoint the plan
([2026-05-19-feat-gravity-ref-bearing-covenant-plan.md](../plans/2026-05-19-feat-gravity-ref-bearing-covenant-plan.md),
Phase 2) requires. Grounded in the real sentinel covenant asm and the
shipped FT/NFT script builders — not in inference.

## Review Outcome (divergent panel, 2026-05-20)

Four reviewers (security-sentinel, architecture-strategist,
code-simplicity, Radiant-script correctness) reviewed this design
**independently** before any bytecode. They converged on one root cause
and several structural improvements. Verdict: **the design's threat
handling was incomplete in a CRITICAL way** — the first draft asserted
only `output[0]`'s bytecode and left every other output unconstrained.
That single under-constraint enables three exploitable attacks. The
two "open questions" the first draft *flagged* were not open; they were
live. Revised mandates below.

### CRITICAL — the covenant must constrain the WHOLE transaction, not just output[0]

The first draft asserted `OP_0 OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE OP_EQUALVERIFY` and
`OP_0 OP_OUTPUTVALUE >= dust`. That is insufficient. Three attacks, one
root cause:

1. **Output-count blindness.** Nothing constrains `OP_TXOUTPUTCOUNT`;
   the spender controls outputs[1..n].
2. **Multi-ref smuggling (was "open question #2" — it is live).** Maker
   funds with two refs (sold ref R + valuable piggyback R2). Radiant
   ref-conservation forces R2 onto *some* output; the covenant pins
   only output[0]=R, so the Maker routes R2 to a Maker-controlled
   output[1]. Taker pays BTC, gets R; Maker keeps R2.
3. **FT value-splitting (was "open question #1" — it is live, and
   consensus does NOT cover it).** Radiant FT conservation sums value
   across **all** outputs sharing the FT script
   ([glyph/script.py:53-54,70](../../src/pyrxd/glyph/script.py#L53):
   "R can split"). Lock N units; settle by sending Taker output[0] = 1
   unit (passes bytecode match + dust) and Maker output[1] = N−1 units
   under the same FT script. `sum_in == sum_out` holds globally; the
   covenant is satisfied; the Taker is shorted N−1.

**Mandated fixes (must be in-script AND proven to REJECT the negative
case on regtest before any byte is trusted):**

- `OP_TXOUTPUTCOUNT <n> OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY` — pin the exact output count.
- `OP_0 OP_OUTPUTVALUE <lockedFtUnits> OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY` — **exact** FT
  value to the Taker, not `>= dust`. (FT units are the output's photon
  value under the FT script.)
- A single-input-ref assertion (`OP_REFDATASUMMARY_UTXO` /
  `refoutputcount`-style — exact opcode TBD on regtest) so a
  multi-ref funding UTXO cannot settle.

This reverses the first draft's FT-amount simplification: **the exact
amount check is required after all**, because consensus governs only
the aggregate, never output[0]'s share. The `lockedFtUnits` value
must therefore be bound into the covenant (constructor param or
asserted equal to the input value).

### Structural improvements (adopted)

- **FT-only v1.** Drop NFT from v1 (Simplicity + others). NFT is a
  second script layout, compile, regtest trail, and audit surface that
  does not serve the "sell credits/tokens" need. Ship FT; NFT is a
  near-mechanical repeat when a real NFT-sale need appears.
- **Build-time template source, not three forked artifacts**
  (Architecture). The security rejection of `refKind` dispatch was
  about *runtime* selectability, not *build-time* templating. Keep one
  human-audited template source with a single substituted
  `<<OUTPUT_CLAUSE>>` region; emit distinct artifacts from it. Avoids
  triplicate drift (a sentinel SPV fix would otherwise need 3× hand-
  application + re-audit).
- **`glyphRef` needs a new `_FIXED_LENGTHS` entry = 36** (Architecture).
  It is NOT "like btcReceiveHash" (that's 32-byte Sha256). Declared as
  plain `bytes` it would skip length validation
  ([covenant.py:217,247](../../src/pyrxd/gravity/covenant.py#L217)) and
  a 35/37-byte ref would silently produce an on-chain-rejected
  covenant. Add `GlyphRef: 36` to the loader.
- **Drop subaddress derivation; reject duplicate BTC addresses in the
  off-chain verifier instead** (Simplicity). `glyphRef` is already in
  the P2SH hash, so the covenant address is already offer-unique. The
  SPV-reuse risk is purely off-chain (a verifier crediting one BTC
  payment to two offers sharing a receive address). An off-chain
  duplicate-address check is less machinery than a key-derivation
  scheme and gives the same property. (Security flagged nonce-
  uniqueness as a HIGH gap in the derivation approach — dropping it
  removes the gap.)
- **Share the FT fingerprint constant** between the covenant template
  generator and `glyph/script.py` (Architecture) so a Glyph version
  bump breaks loudly at build, not silently on-chain.
- **Spike-harness builder is allowed before the production builder**
  (Architecture) — you need *some* tx to submit to regtest. The
  "no Python builders until conservation proven" gate applies to the
  *shipped* builders; a disposable spike harness to produce the
  regtest spend is fine and necessary.

The body below is the original draft, retained for the construction
detail; read it through the lens of the mandates above.

## Spike results (2026-05-20) — opcodes confirmed, FT-amount question RESOLVED

Read-only spike against pyrxd source + the live mainnet node on `tr`,
before writing any bytecode:

1. **All required opcodes exist** ([constants.py:285-320](../../src/pyrxd/constants.py#L285)):
   `OP_TXOUTPUTCOUNT` (`0xc4`), `OP_OUTPUTVALUE` (`0xcc`),
   `OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE` (`0xcd`), and the full ref family —
   `OP_REFVALUESUM_OUTPUTS` (`0xdc`), `OP_REFOUTPUTCOUNT_OUTPUTS`
   (`0xde`), `OP_REFDATASUMMARY_OUTPUT` (`0xe2`), etc. The three
   mandated fixes are all expressible.

2. **FT amount == photon value (1 photon = 1 FT unit).** This resolves
   the load-bearing open question and *confirms* the mandated fix #3
   uses the right opcode. Evidence:
   [glyph_cmds.py:933](../../src/pyrxd/cli/glyph_cmds.py#L933) —
   `ft_amount = utxo.value  # 1 photon = 1 FT unit`. The FT-CSH
   conservation epilogue (`dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d`) sums **photon
   values** across ref-bearing outputs sharing the ref.

   ⚠️ **Misleading docstring corrected:** `ft.py:15-17` calls
   `ft_amount` and `value` "orthogonal." They are distinct *dataclass
   fields* but the SAME on-chain quantity — the FT carrier's photon
   value IS its token amount. So `OP_0 OP_OUTPUTVALUE <lockedUnits>
   OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY` (fix #3) **is correct** — `OP_OUTPUTVALUE`
   returns the photon value, which equals the FT amount. (Briefly
   looked wrong mid-spike because of that docstring; the code at
   glyph_cmds.py:933 is authoritative.)

   Consequence: `lockedFtUnits` = the locked covenant UTXO's photon
   value. The Taker's settlement output[0] must have **exactly** that
   photon value, and `OP_TXOUTPUTCOUNT` must clamp so no sibling FT
   output siphons the rest.

3. **`testmempoolaccept` path confirmed available** on `tr` (node
   synced, wallet funded ~180 RXD) for the negative-case-rejection
   proofs the mandates require.

## Toolchain reconciliation (2026-05-20)

The shipped artifacts were built with `rxdc 0.1.0`; the local
RadiantScript compiler is `rxdc 1.1.0-v2` (`~/apps/RadiantScript`,
a lerna monorepo; `packages/cashc` is the `rxdc` compiler). Checked
whether the version gap breaks compatibility — **it does not:**

- **Artifact format `version: 9` is identical** across the bump
  (shipped sentinel: `version=9` int; compiler `generateArtifact`
  emits `version: 9`). pyrxd's loader keys (`contract`, `hex`, `abi`)
  are all produced; `hex` is an optional artifact field generated via
  `@radiantscript/utils` `scriptToBytecode`.
- **`^0.9.0` is a language pragma**, distinct from the compiler
  package version. The opcode set it targets is the same
  `0xc4`/`0xcc`/`0xdc`/`0xde` family pyrxd already encodes in
  `constants.py`.
- **`TokenSwap.rxd` / `FungibleToken.rxd` examples exist** in the
  compiler repo and use `tx.outputs.refValueSum($ref)` — the exact
  idiom for fix #3. ⚠️ But `TokenSwap.rxd` *itself* has the panel's
  bug: it checks only aggregate `refValueSum` equality and
  `>= amount`, never clamps output count or pins the recipient's
  exact share. **Do not copy it naively** — it is the textbook
  instance of the under-constraint the panel caught.

**Build-session results (2026-05-20):**

- **Compiler built and runs.** `~/apps/RadiantScript/packages/cashc`
  builds with `npm run build` (Node 22); the `rxdc` CLI is
  `dist/main/cashc-cli.js`. Despite the package version `1.1.0-v2`, it
  **stamps `compilerVersion: rxdc 0.1.0`** and emits all 6 artifact
  keys incl. `hex` — i.e. it IS the compiler that built the shipped
  artifacts. No codegen-version gap.
- **Grammar gotcha:** the `examples/radiant/*.rxd` files (with
  `function transfer(...)`, `pragma ^0.9.0`) **do not parse** — wrong
  grammar generation. The accepted grammar is `pragma radiantscript
  ^0.1.0` with bare `function (...)` (see
  `packages/cashc/test/valid-contract-files/rxd_fungible_token.rxd`).
  Write the swap covenant in THAT syntax.
- **Codegen-drift question dissolved.** It was the wrong question. The
  mainnet FT *output* locking script's conservation epilogue
  (`dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d`) is **hard-coded as a literal byte
  constant** in pyrxd's `build_ft_locking_script`
  ([script.py:138](../../src/pyrxd/glyph/script.py#L138)) — it is NOT
  re-derived from a compiler. The freshly-compiled `FungibleToken.rxd`
  produces a *different* epilogue (`c0e9aa...`, reordered opcodes) —
  proving you must NOT regenerate the FT script from source; you must
  reproduce the exact mainnet bytes.

**Consequence for the swap covenant (simplifies it):** the covenant
does **not** re-implement FT conservation. It CATs the *literal*
mainnet FT epilogue into the constructed settlement output, then
asserts the full output bytecode via `OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE
OP_EQUALVERIFY`. FT conservation rides inside that constructed FT
script (enforced by the network when the output is later spent). The
swap covenant's narrower job: bind ref + exact photon value (=FT
amount) + output count, and assert the exact FT output script. This
sidesteps codegen drift entirely — the epilogue is a literal, not a
compiled artifact.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL deployment-model finding (2026-05-20) — bare script, NOT P2SH

While funding a real minted FT into the compiled covenant on mainnet,
hit the load-bearing constraint the design (and the shipped Gravity
covenant) got wrong:

**A ref-bearing covenant cannot be P2SH-wrapped.** Radiant
ref-conservation requires the ref opcode (`OP_PUSHINPUTREF` `0xd0`) to
appear **in the output scriptPubKey**. A P2SH output is `a914<hash>87`
— it shows no ref. So funding a covenant as plain P2SH would *burn*
the ref (conservation violation → tx rejected). Confirmed against a
live glyph UTXO: its scriptPubKey starts with `d8...` (bare ref
opcode), **not** `a914` (P2SH). Photonic's covenants and the dMint
contract UTXO are all **bare scripts** too.

**The contrast with shipped Gravity is real and explains the gap:**
- Plain-RXD Gravity covenant → P2SH-wrapped. Fine — no ref to expose.
- Ref-bearing FT/NFT covenant → **must be a bare script**: the full
  covenant logic lives in the scriptPubKey, prefixed/structured so the
  ref opcode is visible for conservation.

**Impact on the design:**
- The `compute_p2sh_*` machinery the spike reused does NOT apply to the
  ref-bearing variant. The covenant deploys as a bare ref-bearing
  scriptPubKey; "funding" = an FT transfer whose output IS that bare
  covenant script (carrying the ref → conservation satisfied).
- The covenant script must itself begin with (or contain)
  `OP_PUSHINPUTREF <REF>` so the locked UTXO's scriptPubKey exposes the
  ref. The compiled spike already does `pushInputRef(REF)` in its
  preamble — need to confirm that places the ref opcode in the
  *locking* script (deploy form), not only in the *spending* path.
- This is exactly the deploy-model divergence the dMint incidents warn
  about; caught at the funding step *before* burning the real FT.

## ⚠️ DEEPER finding (2026-05-20) — an FT cannot move into an arbitrary ref-bearing covenant

Recomputed the covenant as a **bare** scriptPubKey (it correctly leads
with `OP_PUSHINPUTREF <REF>`, confirmed) and built the funding tx
(FT input → covenant output carrying the ref). The funding dry-run
(`testmempoolaccept`) **rejected** with:

```
19: bad-txns-inputs-outputs-invalid-transaction-reference-operations-mempool
```

The refs match exactly (verified byte-for-byte), so this is NOT a ref
mismatch — it is a **conservation-structure** problem:

- A Radiant FT is bound to **its own code-script** (the
  `dec0e9aa…` FT-CSH epilogue). Conservation is enforced as
  `codeScriptValueSum(FT-code-script, inputs) ==
  codeScriptValueSum(FT-code-script, outputs)` — i.e. the FT value must
  flow to outputs **carrying the same FT code-script**.
- My covenant output declares the ref via `OP_PUSHINPUTREF <REF>` but
  is a *swap covenant script*, NOT the FT's code-script. So the FT's
  `codeScriptValueSum` drops to zero on the output side → conservation
  violation → rejected. (Caught in **dry-run** — the FT was NOT burned.)

**Implication — this is an architecture-level constraint, not a bug:**
you cannot lock an FT into an arbitrary covenant by simply declaring
its ref. The FT is welded to its FT-CSH code-script. To hold an FT in
a covenant, the covenant output must EITHER:

1. **Be the FT code-script itself**, with the swap logic layered so the
   covenant controls the *spend* of a normal FT UTXO (e.g. the covenant
   key/condition is what the FT's P2PKH-prefix checks) — i.e. wrap the
   covenant *inside* the FT script's spend path, not the FT inside the
   covenant; or
2. Use a **different token model** (NFT singleton, or a mutable/contract
   ref) whose conservation rule the covenant can satisfy; or
3. Have the covenant satisfy the FT's `codeScriptValueSum` by being
   counted as an equivalent code-script (likely not possible for an
   arbitrary script).

Option 1 is the probable path and it **inverts the design**: rather
than "lock the FT into the swap covenant," the swap condition must be
expressed *within* an FT-shaped output (or a covenant that re-emits the
exact FT code-script on settlement while gating the spend). This needs
genuine redesign + a likely fresh divergent-review pass.

**Status:** FT minted and **held safe** (ref `57296874…:0`,
100k units — dry-run rejection means nothing was burned). Covenant
compiles with correct hardening opcodes. The blocker is now an
architecture question, not a coding one: *how does an FT-CSH-conserved
token get held by a swap covenant?*

### Photonic investigation (2026-05-20) — and an UNRESOLVED contradiction

Read Photonic's swap + vault code for the canonical pattern:

- **`swap.ts`** (`packages/app/src/swap.ts`) does NOT use a holding
  covenant. It moves the FT to an FT-script at a dedicated **swap
  sub-address** (`ftScript(swapAddress, ref)` — still a normal
  conserving FT UTXO) and uses **SIGHASH-flagged partial signatures**
  (`tx.ts:21,47`) for atomicity. So one real model is: *FTs are never
  held in a non-FT covenant — they stay FT-shaped and swaps are
  pre-signed atomic txs.*

- **`vault.ts`** (`packages/lib/src/vault.ts`) DOES claim to vault FTs
  with an added CLTV constraint, via `vaultFtRedeemScript` (vault.ts:268):
  ```
  <locktime> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
  OP_STATESEPARATOR OP_PUSHINPUTREF <ref>
  OP_REFOUTPUTCOUNT_OUTPUTS OP_INPUTINDEX OP_CODESCRIPTBYTECODE_UTXO
  OP_HASH256 OP_DUP OP_CODESCRIPTHASHVALUESUM_UTXOS OP_OVER
  OP_CODESCRIPTHASHVALUESUM_OUTPUTS OP_GREATERTHANOREQUAL OP_VERIFY
  OP_CODESCRIPTHASHOUTPUTCOUNT_OUTPUTS OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY
  ```
  i.e. the covenant constraint is *prepended* and the **full FT
  conservation epilogue is embedded inside the redeem script**.

**The unresolved contradiction (do NOT build until settled):**
`vault.ts` funds the vault to a **P2SH output**
(`p2shOutputScript` = `OP_HASH160 <hash> OP_EQUAL`, vault.ts:303) —
which exposes **no ref**, exactly the shape the mainnet node REJECTED
in my funding dry-run. And Photonic has **no FT-vault tests**
(searched `packages/lib/test/` — none), so this path may be
**aspirational/untested** (per memory: Photonic is the default
reference but not infallible). Two live possibilities, unresolved:

1. Photonic's FT vault has the same conservation bug my spike hit
   (P2SH funding burns the ref) — i.e. it doesn't actually work
   on-chain for FTs. My mainnet rejection is hard evidence this is
   plausible.
2. Radiant's conservation rule looks *past* the P2SH hash somehow
   (counts refs in the revealed redeem script on the spend side, with
   some funding-side accommodation I haven't found).

**I will not guess between these.** The authoritative answer is in
**Radiant Core's actual conservation algorithm** (the consensus code
that emits `bad-txns-inputs-outputs-invalid-transaction-reference-operations`),
which I have not read. Next session: read that consensus code (or test
Photonic's FT vault directly on regtest/mainnet with a tiny amount) to
determine whether ANY P2SH-wrapped FT covenant can conserve, OR whether
the swap.ts "pre-signed atomic, FT stays FT-shaped" model is the only
viable one. The covenant design depends entirely on which is true.

## ✅ RESOLVED (2026-05-20) — read the consensus source; the DEEPER finding's diagnosis was WRONG

Read Radiant Core's actual induction-rule algorithm (local source
`~/apps/Radiant-Core`, v3.0.0):

- `ReferenceParser::validateTransactionReferenceOperations`
  (`src/validation.h:991`)
- `CScript::GetPushRefs` (`src/script/script.cpp:555`)

**What the rule actually does:** it extracts refs by *linearly scanning
the raw scriptPubKey bytes* for the ref opcodes (0xd0 PUSHINPUTREF,
0xd1 REQUIREINPUTREF, 0xd2/0xd3 DISALLOW…, 0xd8 PUSHINPUTREFSINGLETON),
skipping pushdata operands but otherwise **purely syntactic** — it does
NOT understand the semantics of the script. The conservation rule
(`validatePushRefRule`, validation.h:919): every push/require ref in any
OUTPUT must appear in some INPUT (set_difference outputs−inputs must be
empty); singleton refs are checked separately against the input
singleton set (validation.h:1063). The FT *amount* conservation
(`codeScriptValueSum`) is a SEPARATE, interpreter-side check
(introspection opcodes) — it is **not** what emits this reject string.

**The actual root cause (verified by walking the 264-byte covenant spk
the same way GetPushRefs does):** the covenant embeds the literal
FT-epilogue bytes (`…dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d`) twice as
`OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE` comparison data. A `0xd8` byte at **offset 224**,
sitting inside that embedded template data, gets parsed as a real
`OP_PUSHINPUTREFSINGLETON` consuming the next 36 bytes as a **phantom
ref** `343c4872…269e69d7e00`. That phantom singleton is in no input →
`singletonRefSatisfied = false` → reject. The legitimate
`OP_PUSHINPUTREF <REF>` at offset 0 (matching the FT input) is fine; the
phantom is the killer.

Re-confirmed live: `testmempoolaccept` on the recorded
`.funding_info.json` hex against the mainnet node (`ssh tr`, v2.3.0,
block 430721) reproduced the exact reject string.

**Corrections to the DEEPER finding above:**
- It is NOT a `codeScriptValueSum` / FT-code-script-welding problem.
  That diagnosis was a plausible-sounding guess; the source disproves it.
- It is NOT P2SH-vs-bare. The failing tx was BARE (spk starts `d0`,
  264 bytes — verified). The brief's "P2SH-wrapped" framing was wrong.
- The Photonic `vault.ts` "unresolved contradiction" is moot for our
  purposes: their P2SH funding hides ALL ref opcodes from the parser
  (so a P2SH FT vault funds with zero output refs and would itself fail
  conservation differently) — but our bare covenant's problem is the
  phantom ref, which is fixable.

**Why this is good news:** the blocker is a **script-encoding** problem,
not an architecture dead-end. An FT *can* be held in a bare ref-bearing
covenant — provided the covenant scriptPubKey contains **no byte
sequence that the linear parser will mis-read as a ref opcode followed
by 36 consumable bytes** at any position its pushdata-skipping actually
reaches.

**Mitigations to evaluate next (in order of preference):**
1. **Build the embedded expected-bytecode via `OP_CAT` from fragments**
   so that no `0xd0`/`0xd8` (and `0xd1`–`0xd3`) byte ever lands on a
   scan boundary as a bare opcode — i.e. keep every such byte *inside* a
   pushdata operand the parser skips. This is the surgical fix; the
   phantom at offset 224 is in raw script position, not behind a push.
2. Restructure the comparison so the FT epilogue is never present as
   raw script bytes (e.g. compare a hash of expected bytecode rather
   than the bytecode itself, if introspection allows
   `OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE OP_HASH256 <h> OP_EQUAL`).
3. Only if 1–2 fail: reconsider whether the settlement output must be
   epilogue-shaped inside the covenant at all.

**Next concrete step:** rebuild `build_covenant.py` so the embedded
template bytes are emitted as push-wrapped data, re-scan the resulting
spk with the GetPushRefs walk (must show exactly ONE ref = the FT ref),
then re-run the funding `testmempoolaccept`. Caveat to close first:
local source is v3.0.0 but the live node is v2.3.0 — confirm
ReferenceParser is unchanged between the two tags before trusting the
walk as ground truth.

## ✅✅ ON-CHAIN CONFIRMATION (2026-05-20) — TWO layers, both now understood

After the layer-1 fix (hash-compare covenant, no embedded epilogue bytes
→ phantom ref gone), I re-ran the funding `testmempoolaccept` on the
mainnet node. Two more facts surfaced, both verified:

1. **The spike used the wrong ref.** A Radiant FT's ref is its **genesis
   outpoint** (the commit/mint origin), which persists across transfers
   — NOT the current UTXO's txid. The on-chain FT at `57296874…:0`
   carries ref `1d5cc8…098c:0` = the commit tx `8c09738386d84132…:0`,
   not `57296874…`. The covenant must declare the genesis ref. Fixed.

2. **There is a SECOND gate, and it is the real architectural one.** With
   the correct ref and a fee above 10k photons/byte, the reject advanced
   from `…reference-operations` → `min relay fee not met` → finally
   `mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script failed an
   OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY operation)`. That last failure is the **FT's own
   conservation epilogue executing at spend time** — `…dec0e9aa76e378…`
   contains `OP_CODESCRIPTHASHVALUESUM_UTXOS` (`e3`) /
   `OP_CODESCRIPTHASHVALUESUM_OUTPUTS` (`e4`) and a final
   `OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY`. Per `interpreter.cpp:2215`
   (`getCodeScriptHashValueSumOutputs`), it sums photons of **outputs
   whose code-script HASH matches the FT's**. Moving the FT into a
   covenant output (whose code-script ≠ the FT epilogue) yields
   outputs-sum 0 ≠ inputs-sum 100,000 → fail.

**So the DEEPER finding's conclusion was right after all** (the FT is
welded to its code-script) — it was just attributed to the wrong reject
string. The reference-induction rule (layer 1) and the
`codeScriptHashValueSum` epilogue (layer 2) are **independent gates**.
Fixing layer 1 was necessary but not sufficient.

**What this means for the design (the inversion is now mandatory, not
optional):** you cannot hold an FT inside a foreign swap covenant. The
settlement output must itself be **FT-code-script-shaped** so the FT's
epilogue conserves. The swap condition has to be expressed either:
- as a covenant that gates the *spend path* of a normal FT UTXO (the
  covenant key/condition is what the FT's P2PKH-prefix checks), re-emitting
  the exact FT code-script on settlement; or
- via the pre-signed-atomic model (Photonic `swap.ts`): the FT stays
  FT-shaped at a swap sub-address, atomicity from SIGHASH partial sigs —
  no holding covenant at all.

This needs a genuine redesign + fresh divergent-review pass before any
bytecode. The hash-compare covenant and the phantom-ref/genesis-ref fixes
are committed on `feat/gravity-ref-ft-covenant-spike`; they remain useful
as the *output-validation* half of the inverted design. The test FT
(`57296874…:0`, 100k units) is UNSPENT — every probe was a dry-run.

---

**Single review question this doc must survive:** *what does shipping
this normalize, and what is the day-1 attack?*

## Context the design rests on (verified, with sources)

1. **The sentinel covenant already constructs its settlement output
   compositionally and asserts it by introspection** — it does not use
   `hashOutputs`. From the real artifact asm
   (`maker_covenant_flat_12x20_sentinel_all`, finalize branch):

   ```
   76a914 $takerRadiantPkh OP_CAT 88ac OP_CAT     # build P2PKH scriptPubKey
   OP_0 OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE OP_EQUALVERIFY           # assert output[0] == it
   OP_0 OP_OUTPUTVALUE $totalPhotonsInOutput OP_GREATERTHANOREQUAL OP_VERIFY
   ```

   The forfeit branch is structurally identical, swapping `$makerPkh`
   for `$takerRadiantPkh` and gating on
   `$claimDeadline OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP`:

   ```
   $claimDeadline OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
   76a914 $makerPkh OP_CAT 88ac OP_CAT
   OP_0 OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE OP_EQUALVERIFY
   OP_0 OP_OUTPUTVALUE $totalPhotonsInOutput OP_GREATERTHANOREQUAL
   ```

2. **The FT/NFT locking scripts are fixed-shape with one variable
   field (the 36-byte ref).** From `glyph/script.py`:

   - **FT (75 bytes):** `76a914 <pkh:20> 88ac` `bd` `d0` `<ref:36>`
     `dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d`
     (P2PKH + `OP_STATESEPARATOR` + `OP_PUSHINPUTREF` + ref + 12-byte
     FT conservation fingerprint)
   - **NFT (63 bytes):** `d8` `<ref:36>` `7576a914 <pkh:20> 88ac`
     (`OP_PUSHINPUTREFSINGLETON` + ref + `OP_DROP OP_DUP` + P2PKH tail)

3. **Photonic has no transfer/swap covenant to copy** (see
   [spike-findings addendum](2026-05-19-gravity-ref-covenant-spike-findings.md)).
   dMint's self-rebuild (`require(output.stateScript == rebuilt_bytes)`)
   is the closest mechanism; ref-to-arbitrary-destination is novel.

## The design

Two separate artifacts (`maker_covenant_ft_v1`, `maker_covenant_nft_v1`)
per the plan's security decision. Each is a fork of the sentinel
covenant where **only the constructed-output bytecode changes** —
everything BTC-facing (SPV proof, `btcReceiveType` dispatch,
sentinel-padded Merkle depth, `claimDeadline`) is reused verbatim.

### New constructor param

Add `glyphRef` (36 bytes) to the constructor, substituted into the hex
template exactly like `btcReceiveHash`. **This binds the ref into the
P2SH redeem-script hash** — the offer's identity includes the exact ref
being sold (Security #1: ref substitution is impossible because a
different ref produces a different P2SH address).

FT also adds `ftAmount`? **No — see the FT-amount decision below.**

### Settlement clause (FT)

Replace the sentinel's P2PKH-output construction with the FT script
construction, then assert by introspection as today:

```
76a914 $takerRadiantPkh OP_CAT 88ac OP_CAT      # P2PKH prefix  (unchanged)
bd OP_CAT                                        # + OP_STATESEPARATOR
d0 OP_CAT                                        # + OP_PUSHINPUTREF
$glyphRef OP_CAT                                 # + the locked ref (constructor param)
dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d OP_CAT                  # + FT conservation fingerprint
OP_0 OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE OP_EQUALVERIFY            # assert output[0] == the FT script
OP_0 OP_OUTPUTVALUE <dust> OP_GREATERTHANOREQUAL OP_VERIFY
```

The settlement output is now a 75-byte FT output to the Taker's PKH
carrying the locked ref. RXD value drops to dust (the value side is no
longer the asset; the ref is).

### Settlement clause (NFT)

Same shape, NFT script layout:

```
d8 $glyphRef OP_CAT                              # OP_PUSHINPUTREFSINGLETON + ref
7576a914 OP_CAT $takerRadiantPkh OP_CAT 88ac OP_CAT
OP_0 OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_0 OP_OUTPUTVALUE <dust> OP_GREATERTHANOREQUAL OP_VERIFY
```

(Exact CAT ordering and minimal-push encoding of the literal opcode
bytes is a compile detail to validate on regtest; the structure is what
matters for review.)

### Forfeit clause (FT and NFT)

Identical change: the sentinel forfeit builds `76a914 $makerPkh 88ac`;
the ref version builds the **same FT/NFT script but to `$makerPkh`**, so
the reclaimed UTXO carries the original ref back to the Maker. Gated by
`$claimDeadline OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` unchanged.

This satisfies the trust property "forfeit returns the *original*
ref-bearing UTXO" — the reclaimed output is constructed to carry the
same `$glyphRef`.

## How the four threats are handled

| Threat | Handling in this design |
|---|---|
| **Ref substitution (Security #1)** | `glyphRef` is a constructor param → baked into the P2SH hash. A different ref ⇒ different covenant address ⇒ Maker never funded it. The settlement clause constructs the expected output from `$glyphRef`, so the Taker cannot redirect a different ref. |
| **Multi-ref smuggling (Security #2, Critical)** | The settlement/forfeit output bytecode is asserted *exactly* (`OP_EQUALVERIFY` on full scriptPubKey), so the output carries exactly the one constructed ref. **Open question:** does asserting output[0]'s bytecode also need an explicit ref-*count* constraint on the spend to stop a *second* smuggled ref riding a different output? Radiant ref-conservation should force any input ref onto an output, so a smuggled funding ref must appear somewhere — needs an explicit `refoutputcount`-style check or a total-outputs constraint. **MUST resolve on regtest before shipping.** |
| **SPV proof reuse across offers (Security #5, Critical)** | Subaddress derivation: `btcReceiveHash` derived from `(makerPkh, glyphRef, nonce)` so each offer's BTC receive address is unique → one BTC payment proves exactly one covenant. (Chosen over OP_RETURN to avoid excluding consumer BTC wallets.) |
| **refKind branch confusion (Security #6)** | Eliminated by construction: two separate artifacts, no in-script `refKind` dispatch, no selectable branch. |

## The FT-amount decision (important)

**The FT amount is NOT carried in the ref or in a covenant param.**
Per the Photonic finding (`fungible.rxd`), Radiant FT conservation is a
**consensus-level value check** — `codeScriptValueSum(inputs) >=
codeScriptValueSum(outputs)` for outputs sharing the FT code-script
hash. The FT "amount" is the UTXO's photon value under the FT script,
not a separate field.

Consequence for the covenant: by constructing the exact FT output
script (which includes the FT fingerprint) and asserting it via
`OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE`, **the covenant pins the ref and the script shape;
Radiant consensus pins the amount conservation.** This means:

- The plan's `FtAmount`/`amount` constructor param and the
  `sum-in == sum-out` *in-script* check are likely **unnecessary** —
  consensus already enforces it. This simplifies the covenant.
- **Open question to confirm on regtest:** does locking N FT units into
  the covenant and asserting the FT output script guarantee the Taker
  receives exactly N, or could a malicious settlement split value? The
  `OP_OUTPUTVALUE >= dust` check governs RXD, not FT units. Need to
  verify the FT-fingerprint consensus check covers this. **This is the
  single most important thing to validate before writing the builder.**

If consensus does NOT fully cover it, fall back to an explicit
in-script value assertion. Either way, this is a regtest question, not
a design-by-inference question.

## What stays exactly as the sentinel covenant

- SPV proof verification (block headers, Merkle proof, sentinel padding
  depth 12–20)
- `btcReceiveType` four-way dispatch (P2PKH/P2WPKH/P2SH/P2TR)
- `btcChainAnchor`, `expectedNBits`, `expectedNBitsNext` PoW binding
- `claimDeadline` + `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` forfeit gate
- The P2SH-wrapping and `CovenantArtifact` substitution machinery

## Open questions to resolve on regtest (before bytecode is "done")

1. **FT conservation coverage** (above) — does asserting the FT output
   script + consensus conservation guarantee the Taker gets exactly the
   locked amount? *Highest priority.*
2. **Multi-ref smuggling** — is exact-output-bytecode assertion
   sufficient, or is an explicit ref-count constraint needed?
3. **Minimal-push encoding** of the literal opcode bytes (`bd`, `d0`,
   `d8`, the fingerprint) inside `OP_CAT` chains — confirm the compiler
   emits them as data pushes, not as executed opcodes.
4. **Script size / fee** — measure both artifacts vs sentinel; confirm
   ≤ 1.5× gate.
5. **`OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE` on a ref-bearing output** — never exercised by
   the sentinel covenant; confirm the node accepts the spend
   (`testmempoolaccept`) before any golden-byte fixture is trusted.

## Recommended sequence (unchanged from plan, now concrete)

1. **Adversarial review of THIS doc** (the checkpoint) — answer the
   single review question above.
2. Draft FT template → compile → regtest lock/release/forfeit →
   resolve open questions 1–3.
3. Repeat for NFT.
4. Benchmark (open question 4), record in spike-findings.
5. Only then bolt on the BTC half (Phase 4) and write Python builders.

**Do not write the Python tx builders or the BTC half until the FT
conservation question (1) is answered on a real regtest spend.** That
is the load-bearing unknown; everything downstream depends on it.

## Phase 1 design note — custody mechanism RESOLVED (2026-05-20)

This is the Phase-1 deliverable from
[2026-05-20-feat-gravity-ft-covenant-spend-path-plan.md](../plans/2026-05-20-feat-gravity-ft-covenant-spend-path-plan.md).
The load-bearing conservation question is **answered from the consensus
source** (not regtest yet — that is the Phase-2 confirmation), and it
answers favorably: **mechanism 1a is viable by construction.**

### The reframed question, answered from source

`getCodeScriptHashValueSum*` groups outputs/UTXOs by their
**`codeScriptHash`**. That hash is computed in
`Radiant-Core/src/script/script_execution_context.h:275-285`:

```cpp
// Create the codeScriptHash
if (stateSeperatorByteIndex >= script.size()) {
    ... hash of empty tail ...
} else {
    CScript::const_iterator scriptStateSeperatorIterator =
        script.begin() + stateSeperatorByteIndex;
    CHashWriter ...;
    hashWriter << CFlatData(CScript(scriptStateSeperatorIterator, script.end()));
    scriptSummary.codeScriptHash = hashWriter.GetHash();
}
```

The hash covers **`script.begin() + stateSeperatorByteIndex` → `end()`**
— i.e. the bytes **from `OP_STATESEPARATOR` (`0xbd`) onward**. Everything
*before* the separator (the prologue: P2PKH or covenant) is **excluded
from the codeScriptHash**.

`stateSeperatorByteIndex` is the position of the single
`OP_STATESEPARATOR`, located by `GetPushRefs`
(`src/script/script.cpp:609-624,644`); two separators → `GetPushRefs`
returns false → tx rejected; zero separators → index 0 (whole script
hashed).

### Consequence — 1a works by construction

For an FT `prologue ‖ bd ‖ d0 <ref> ‖ dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d`:

- `codeScriptHash = hash( bd d0 <ref> dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d )` —
  the separator + ref-push + FT-CSH epilogue. **Prologue-independent.**
- A **covenant-prologue** FT input
  (`<covenant-condition> bd d0 <ref> dec0…`) and a **standard-P2PKH-prologue**
  FT output (`76a914<pkh>88ac bd d0 <ref> dec0…`) therefore share the
  **same** `codeScriptHash` ⇒ `codeScriptHashValueSum` counts them
  together ⇒ **they conserve.**

This is exactly what Option A needs: gate the spend via the prologue
(which is not hashed), settle to the standard FT script
(`build_ft_locking_script`, the one `EXPECTED_TAKER_FT_HASH` is computed
from), and conservation holds.

### Decisions locked

1. **Mechanism: 1a** (covenant condition replaces/precedes the P2PKH
   prologue, *before* the `bd` separator). 1b is rejected (no on-chain
   custody — see plan C2).
2. **Prologue constraint (hard):** the covenant prologue must contain
   **no `OP_STATESEPARATOR` (`0xbd`) in opcode position** before the
   FT epilogue's separator — otherwise `GetPushRefs` takes the wrong
   boundary (or fails on a second separator), shifting/breaking the
   `codeScriptHash`. The prologue must also contain no stray ref-opcode
   bytes in opcode position (phantom-ref guard already covers this).
3. **Custody invariant (C1):** the covenant has **exactly two spend
   paths** — finalize-on-SPV-proof and forfeit-after-CLTV — and **no
   Maker-only pre-deadline reclaim**. The existing RXD covenant's
   `cancel()` branch is NOT inherited.
4. **Settlement output:** the standard FT script for the destination
   pkh (`build_ft_locking_script(dest_pkh, genesis_ref)`); covenant
   asserts `hash256(outputs[0].lockingBytecode) == EXPECTED_*_FT_HASH`.

### Still unproven (Phase 2 must confirm on a real node)

The source says 1a *should* conserve. Phase 2 must still
`testmempoolaccept` an actual covenant-prologue FT spend → standard-FT
output and confirm: (a) no `OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY`/conservation failure,
(b) the prologue's bytes are genuinely outside the hashed region in
practice (no off-by-one at the separator index), (c) all negative cases
(no-cancel, SPV-reuse, ==-not->= amount) reject. The source read
de-risks the unknown from "unknown" to "very likely yes" — it does not
replace the on-chain proof.

---

## Phase 2 — RADIANT-ONLY COVENANT PROVEN ON-CHAIN (2026-05-20)

Mechanism 1a is validated on the live mainnet node (`ssh tr`). The
covenant-prologue FT (`GravityFtPrologue` compiled + `bd d0 <ref>
dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d` epilogue, 217 B) was exercised end-to-end.

**Leg A — conservation (broadcast).** Standard test FT
`57296874…:0` → covenant-prologue FT UTXO. `sendrawtransaction` →
txid `22912a58196dbf627b3db631d151af5f4c69922e3c69635f0d5ed6b383abc594`,
vout 0 = the 100k-photon covenant-prologue FT. Confirms the Phase-1
source prediction empirically: a covenant-prologue (custom-prologue) FT
output shares the standard FT's `codeScriptHash` and conserves.

**Leg B — release (`testmempoolaccept` allowed).** Spend the
prologue-FT via `settle` (selector OP_0, taker sig) → standard taker FT
output. txid `069c46c8…`, `"allowed": true`. Executes the full path:
taker `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY`, the 3 hardening constraints
(`outputs.length==1`, `refOutputCount==1`, `refValueSum==AMOUNT`), the
hash-compare (`hash256(output[0]) == EXPECTED_TAKER_FT_HASH`), and the FT
epilogue conservation — all pass.

**Negative-case matrix — all reject on-chain** (`build_leg_b_negatives.py`):

| Case | reject-reason | constraint |
|---|---|---|
| `extra_output` (2 outputs) | OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY | output-count clamp |
| `wrong_taker` (FT to attacker pkh) | false top stack | hash-compare |
| `short_amount` (value = AMOUNT-1) | OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY | refValueSum==AMOUNT |
| `cancel_attempt` (selector OP_2) | OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY | no third branch — **C1** |

`cancel_attempt` proves the **custody invariant**: selectors other than
settle(0)/forfeit(1) hit `OP_1 OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY` in the else-branch and
fail. There is no Maker-only pre-deadline reclaim — the day-1 theft the
divergent review caught (C1) is structurally impossible.

**What is NOT yet proven:** this covenant has **no BTC/SPV gate** — the
`settle` path is gated by a taker sig only (keeps the spike tx
well-formed). The BTC-payment requirement (SPV proof) and the on-chain
SPV-reuse binding (H1) are Phase-4 work. The conservation + custody +
hardening half is done; cross-chain atomicity is not.

**Asset state:** Leg A is broadcast, so the test FT now lives in the
covenant-prologue UTXO `22912a58…:0`, recoverable via `settle` (taker
key) or `forfeit` (maker key, after CLTV deadline 430806). Harnesses:
`build_prologue_ft.py`, `build_leg_a.py`, `build_leg_b.py`,
`build_leg_b_negatives.py`.

## Phase 4 fusion design note (2026-05-20) — splice the BTC/SPV half onto the FT prologue

**Goal:** produce one FT covenant = `<FT prologue + SPV finalize/forfeit> bd d0 <ref> dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d`, fusing the Phase-2-proven FT prologue with the production SPV covenant
(`gravity-rxd-prototype/contracts/maker_covenant_trade.rxd`, generated by
`generators/gen_maker_covenant.js 6 12 --flat --btc-type p2wpkh`).

### What stays identical (reuse verbatim)
The entire `finalize` SPV block from the production covenant: chain-identity
anchor (`h1Prev == btcChainAnchor`), the fixed 1-input segwit tx-layout
constraint, the N=6 header PoW checks (`nBits == expectedNBits ||
expectedNBitsNext`), the M=12 Merkle branch fold, root-membership
(`current == root1..root6`), and the BTC payment check (`value >=
btcSatoshis`, `scriptSection` prefix + `hash == btcReceiveHash`). The
`claimDeadline >= FLOOR` S1 guard stays. No `cancel` branch (C1 holds).

### What changes for FT (the contained delta)

1. **Constructor (gen flat path, lines 332–342).** Add FT params and drop the
   ones the FT epilogue/hardening subsume:
   - ADD `bytes36 REF` (the genesis ref — also pushed by the appended epilogue),
     `int amount` (exact FT units), `bytes32 expectedTakerFtHash`,
     `bytes32 expectedMakerFtHash`.
   - KEEP `makerPkh`, `btcReceiveHash`, `btcSatoshis`, `btcChainAnchor`,
     `expectedNBits`, `expectedNBitsNext`, `claimDeadline`.
   - DROP `takerRadiantPkh` and `totalPhotonsInOutput` (the taker destination
     is pinned by `expectedTakerFtHash`; the value is pinned exactly by the
     FT hardening, not a `>=` floor).

2. **Shared preamble (after the `claimDeadline` require, before `return`).**
   Prepend the Phase-2-proven FT hardening, which runs on BOTH branches:
   ```
   bytes36 ref = pushInputRef(REF);
   require(tx.outputs.length == 1);              // output-count clamp
   require(tx.outputs.refOutputCount(ref) == 1); // single ref
   require(tx.outputs.refValueSum(ref) == amount); // EXACT amount (== not >=, closes H2)
   ```

3. **finalize output routing (gen lines 473–478) →** replace the P2PKH route
   with hash-compare to the taker FT script:
   ```
   require(hash256(tx.outputs[0].lockingBytecode) == expectedTakerFtHash);
   ```
   (Drop the `LockingBytecodeP2PKH(takerRadiantPkh)` + `value >=` lines — the
   destination is the exact FT script, the value is the exact `refValueSum`.)

4. **forfeit (gen lines 484–489) →** keep `tx.time >= claimDeadline`, replace
   the route with `require(hash256(tx.outputs[0].lockingBytecode) ==
   expectedMakerFtHash);`.

5. **Append the FT epilogue** to the compiled bytecode (NOT in the .rxd source —
   the compiler would emit it differently): `bd d0 <ref-bytes> dec0e9aa76e378e4a269e69d`.
   This is the codeScriptHash boundary. The substituter does this after
   placeholder substitution, exactly as Phase-2 `build_prologue_ft.py` does.

### H1 — on-chain SPV-reuse binding (the security review's blocker)
The production covenant binds the BTC payment to `(btcReceiveHash,
btcSatoshis)`. Two concurrent FT offers from the same maker to the same BTC
address would both accept the same SPV proof. The off-chain dup-check is
insufficient for settle-by-anyone. **Binding:** derive `btcReceiveHash`
per-offer as `hash160( makerPubkey ‖ REF ‖ nonce )` (a fresh BTC receive
subaddress per offer), with the nonce a real distinct input so two
same-(maker,REF,amount) offers still differ. This is a Phase-4 generator+
builder concern; it is enforced on-chain because the covenant only accepts a
proof of payment to *its* committed `btcReceiveHash`. Prove on regtest/mainnet:
one BTC payment settles offer A but offer B's covenant REJECTS that proof.

### The two static guards that must pass on the fused, compiled artifact
Before any on-chain step (this is the novel Phase-4 risk):
1. **No bare `0xbd` (OP_STATESEPARATOR) in opcode position** anywhere in the
   compiled prologue+SPV block — else the codeScriptHash boundary shifts off
   the epilogue's `bd`. The SPV block is full of `split`/byte literals; a
   stray `0xbd` in opcode position (not push-wrapped) would break conservation.
   Walk with the opcode-aware walker; assert the FIRST opcode-position `0xbd`
   is the epilogue separator.
2. **`count_input_refs(full_script) == {REF: n}`** — exactly the genesis ref,
   no phantom. The large SPV block could contain a `0xd0`–`0xd8` byte in opcode
   position; the guard catches it.

If either guard fails, the SPV block needs a byte-level fix (push-wrap the
offending literal, or restructure) before proceeding — same class of fix as
the Phase-1 phantom-ref resolution.

### Build approach
Extend `gen_maker_covenant.js` with an FT mode (`--ft` flag): emit the FT
constructor params, the hardening preamble, and the hash-compare routes;
keep everything else. Generate, compile with `rxdc 0.1.0`, run the two static
guards, THEN the on-chain legs (fund FT into the fused covenant; finalize with
a real SPV proof; forfeit; negatives). Reuse `build_finalize_tx`'s SPV-proof
scriptSig assembly from pyrxd `gravity/transactions.py`.
